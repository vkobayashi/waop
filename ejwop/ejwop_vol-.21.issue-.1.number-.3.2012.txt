This study investigated the buffering role of learning opportunities in the process leading from unmet expectations to turnover intentions, via emotional exhaustion. In a sample of 420 teachers in elementary education, the results of a mediated moderation analysis showed a significant positive relationship between unmet expectations and turnover intentions, via emotional exhaustion. Learning opportunities were found to buffer for the relationship between unmet expectation and emotional exhaustion in the sense that this relationship was weaker when learning opportunities were high. Also the mediated relationship between unmet expectations and turnover intentions via emotional exhaustion was weaker when learning opportunities were high. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
