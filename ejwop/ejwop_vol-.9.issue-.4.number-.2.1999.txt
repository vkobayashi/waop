This article describes an innovative methodology based on inter-organizational collaboration between academics and practitioners, using a <U+0093>co-research<U+0094> method that builds on but goes beyond the methodology of insider/outsider research teams. Co-research establishes a dialectical process of enquiry by drawing on the complementary perspectives, interests, skills, and knowledge bases of academics and practitioners. Co-research is based on a triad of research roles. First, the academic responsible for the research, who manages the research team and who contributes an <U+0093>outsider<U+0094> view of the organization. Second, the host manager employed by the organization being researched. This person brings an <U+0093>insider<U+0094> perspective on the organization. Third, the co-researcher from a different organization who carries out the research alongside the academic(s). He or she is an <U+0093>insider<U+0094> in that they are familiar with the type of organization being researched, but an <U+0093>outsider<U+0094> in that their own organization has a different context and processes. This article argues that co-research is effective in producing valid organizational research, partly through the harnessing of inside/outsider knowledge and partly through <U+0093>surprise and sense-making<U+0094> (Louis, 1980). The research paradigm is one of knowledge generation through a negotiated and dialectical approach to organizational processes.
