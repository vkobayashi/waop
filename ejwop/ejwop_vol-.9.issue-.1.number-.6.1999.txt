Advances in our knowledge of entrepreneurship are enabling progress to be made. In this article, entrepreneurship is considered as a process in which the entrepreneur and the entrepreneurial process are aspects of the same phenomenon. In order to capture this process, a social constructionist theoretical framework is adopted. The article develops an explanation of how the social construction of the entrepreneurial personality may be placed in the context of the social construction of their business reality. Fundamental defining assumptions are discussed, in particular, the opportunistic behaviour of the individual to whom the attribution ''entrepreneur'' is made. Finally, a seven-point research agenda is presented.
