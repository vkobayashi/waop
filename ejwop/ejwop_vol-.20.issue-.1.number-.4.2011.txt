This contribution comments on the article by Bakker, Albrecht, and Leiter on “Key Questions Regarding Work Engagement” (2011 this issue). I argue that it is important to conceptually distinguish between work engagement and burnout measures and to relate the vigour-dedication-absorption conceptualization of work engagement to other engagement concepts. State work engagement should receive more attention in future engagement studies, with a particular emphasis on fluctuations within days. Moreover, the role of task features should come more into the forefront of engagement research. Future research might benefit from examining potential negative effects of work engagement by addressing domain-specific implications, by testing curvilinear relationship, and by examining moderator variables.
