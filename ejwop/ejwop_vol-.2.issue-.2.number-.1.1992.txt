In a comparative study involving approximately 900 UK and German adults, an attempt was made to explore the strength of the relationships between diverse but related work attitudes and to examine national differences in work attitudes, which may be related to economic growth. The UK sample preferred business-oriented occupations, rather than the professions—medicine, social work and teaching—(jobs in which Germans expressed higher interest) and was characterized by higher scores on work ethic, achievement motivation, competitiveness, and achievement/conformity, but lower scores on positive attitudes to savings. No significant difference was observed in terms of financial beliefs (valuation of money) or mastery. Work attitude and occupational interest were intimately interrelated, although the relationship was significantly moderated by gender. Socio-historical economic and political origins of these similarities and differences are discussed, along with the theoretical and methodological implications of these findings.
