Guided by social exchange theory, this study found support for the prediction that the relationship of psychological contract breaches to voice behaviour (both constructive and aggressive) would be moderated by changes in leader–member exchange and coworker exchange over time. Specifically, the positive relationship between psychological contract breach and aggressive voice behaviour was weakened when employees had experienced increases in leader–member exchange during the preceding 8-month period. In addition, the relationships of psychological contract breaches with constructive and aggressive voice were also moderated by changes in coworker exchange over time. The article concludes with a discussion of the importance of improving the quality of relationships with superiors and colleagues as a means of mitigating breaches of psychological contracts with the organization as a whole.
