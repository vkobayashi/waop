Retirement represents an important life event in Western countries marking the transition from one life stage to another and the movement from being within to being outside the labour force. For employees, retirement might represent the border between organizational life and life outside the workplace. This border, though commonly thought of as fixed and distinct, is becoming more and more blurred. Organizations and organizational psychology have thus far largely ignored retirement as a relevant topic. However, the changing nature of retirement, as a consequence of demographic changes and developments in the labour market, means that we need to rethink our assumptions about retirement and to attempt to specify some of the missing links between individual and organizational perspectives on retirement. We will argue that retirement is not only an important event in the life of working individuals but has become an important issue for management. This article will discuss some individual retirement processes and possible impacts of retirement on the organization focusing, in particular, on the use of early retirement schemes as a management tool replacing traditional redundancies. It is suggested that these early retirement schemes neglect some basic aspects of individual and organizational retirement processes and are likely therefore in some cases to be less than effective. By describing a different model for managing retirement we aim to suggest how a better balance between individual and organizational needs can be achieved.
