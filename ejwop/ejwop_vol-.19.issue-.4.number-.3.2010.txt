Although psychological theory acknowledges the existence of complex systems and the importance of nonlinear effects, linear statistical models have been traditionally used to examine relationships between environmental stimuli and outcomes. The way we analyse these relationships does not seem to reflect the way we conceptualize them. The present study investigated the application of connectionism (artificial neural networks) to modelling the relationships between work characteristics and employee health by comparing it with a more conventional statistical linear approach (multiple linear regression) on a sample of 1003 individuals in employment. Comparisons of performance metrics indicated differences in model fit, with neural networks to some extent outperforming the linear regression models, such that R 2 for worn-out and job satisfaction were significantly higher in the neural networks. Most importantly, comparisons revealed that the predictors in the two approaches differed in their relative importance for predicting outcomes. The improvement is attributed to the ability of the neural networks to model complex nonlinear relationships. Being unconstrained by assumptions of linearity, they can provide a better approximation of such psychosocial phenomena. Nonlinear approaches are often better fitted for purpose, as they conform to the need for correspondence between theory, method, and data.
