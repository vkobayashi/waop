The stress-oriented job analysis instrument ISTA was applied to a sample of 232 office jobs to analyse the impact of new technologies on the stressor-strain relationship. Scales measuring work content (complexity of work, variety), stressors (time pressure, organizational problems, interruptions, concentration necessities, social stressors), and resources (control at work, control over time) were developed and demonstrated desirable scale characteristics. The results showed positive correlations between stressors and psychological dysfunctioning (psychosomatic complaints, irritation). Computer work was associated with a decrease of work stressors, but also with decreased job content. Work places using different software systems (word processing, specialist, spreadsheet, and graphic programs) manifested different characteristics regarding work content, stressors, and resources. For example, when working with word processors, most stressors occurred at a medium daily computer work time. This indicates that strategies of work design which involve computer and non-computer work have to be used carefully.
