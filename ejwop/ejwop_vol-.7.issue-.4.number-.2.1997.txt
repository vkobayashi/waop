This study is an empirical examination of the planning and allocating strategies of employees in complex work roles characterized by high discretion and multiple demands. A cross-sectional survey design was used to test the relationship between particular types of strategies and individual work performance as rated by both supervisors and peers. In a sample of technical and administrative professionals, some support was found for the benefits of two planning strategies: focusing on priorities and contingency planning. A third planning strategy, anchored planning, was associated with high performance for employees with moderate experience, but not employees with very short or very long experience. In terms of allocation strategies, holding priorities which were consistent with that of the supervisor did not aid performance, but actually allocating time in a manner consistent with the priorities of the supervisor was related to individual performance. Implications for training and motivating individuals in complex jobs are offered.
