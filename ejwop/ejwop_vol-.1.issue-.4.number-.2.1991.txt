Biodata instruments can be used in selection for several purposes (including screening, prediction, analysis of decision strategies). This article is concerned with the construction and validation of a biodata instrument for the selection of intermediaries by a profit-making employment agency in the Netherlands. The instrument was constructed according to the sample approach and measures work experiences with regard to relevant tasks and job dimensions. A field study gathered biodata scores from applicants (n £ 300) and present employees (n £ 70), interview ratings from the applicants, and ratings of job performance for the employees. The results obtained indicated that the instrument was a potentially useful selection device. The homogeneity of scale scores was sufficient and the scores show little overlap with other selection devices (interview ratings). In addition, particular scores correlate at a statistically significant level (P < 0.01) with ratings of job performance of present employees (r £ 0.30 to 0.40). Estimates of the utility (financial gains) of using the instrument in selection revealed that the instrument may yield considerable pay-offs. It is concluded that the construction and validation of the instrument yielded several positive results, and that the sample approach in constructing biodata selection instruments is an option worth considering.
