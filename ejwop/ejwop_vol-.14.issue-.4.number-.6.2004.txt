This study tested the predictions of the uncertainty management model in explaining employee well-being. On the basis of this model we hypothesized that job insecurity would moderate the association between procedural justice (i.e., procedural and interactional justice) and well-being (i.e., emotional exhaustion and stress symptoms). Linear hierarchical regression models were used to analyse data on 1443 employees in the municipal technical sector. The findings of the study supported the hypothesis. Employees who perceived the organization as unfair and experienced job insecurity were at a higher risk of emotional exhaustion and stress symptoms. However, the results were partly gender specific.
