The contrasting outcomes of the two projects are attributed to two main sets of factors: managerial and technical. The technical design philosophy at Manchester was “user centred”; it embraced what may be called a “tool paradigm”, where the aim of technological innovation is to support and augment the role of the human operator. In contrast, the London project was highly Tayloristic, with the accent on replacing unreliable human labour by an automated system. The way the implementation process was managed at Manchester (strong leadership, user involvement) was also notably different from the London experience (weak project management, poor industrial relations). These findings suggest that human-centred principles can provide a highly effective foundation for design, but careful management of the implementation process is also required if ITprojects are to be brought to successful fruition.
