The creation of a new journal offers the chance, to do something different and we have undertaken this task out of a sense of excitement at the new opportunities. In what follows we try to make clear what we would like to publish; we will do all we can to facilitate such contributions. In the end, we depend on you to send us work of this kind and to referee potential contributions in ways that reflect the valuations we are about to describe. What follows is an invitation to potential contributors to help construct a truly European journal to develop thought and practice in European Work & Organizational (W & O) Psychology.
