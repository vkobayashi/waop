In response to the lead article “The study of organizational behavior in Family Business” (this issue), the present commentary focuses on the study of family-owned businesses from a positive organizational perspective with the aim of enriching the avenues for research proposed by the authors. Based on the socioemotional wealth approach, it is argued that family-owned firms represent a unique organizational context to advance positive organizational scholarship (POS) concepts. Likewise, the field of POS is emphasized as an important field of study to increase our understanding of family-owned businesses. In a selective review of the literature, the topic of prosocial practices is discussed. In doing so, it is hoped that scholars begin embracing the fertile territory at the interface between POS and family-business research.
