This longitudinal retrospective study shows that when the results of an organizational development intervention are fed back properly and action plans are made, factors associated with leadership and commitments to organization are enhanced. The study compared the effects of survey feedback, including the making of action plans and survey feedback without action plans, to the effects of no feedback at all on several psychosocial factors and sick leave over a 3-year period. The data were derived from 1236 individuals for whom baseline data were available and who completed a 3-year follow-up. Applied statistics revealed that the feedback action plan group reported greater improvements regarding leadership factors and commitment to the organization. The results reveal no differences between the feedback groups in regard to sick leave. There is a need for further studies, preferably with a randomized control design, on how to enhance both the psychosocial work environment and employee health and also how to reduce sick leave in the workplace.
