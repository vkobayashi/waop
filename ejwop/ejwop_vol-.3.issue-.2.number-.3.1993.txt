Mental information work (MIW) can be characterized as work with information and information objects in which mental activities predominate. We examine some problems concerned with the analysis of MIW for (re)design purposes, related to: (1) the accessibility of mental activity for analysis; (2) the complexity of person-task interaction; and (3) the establishment and use of norms in evaluation and (re)design. Furthermore, we describe the structure and contents of a method for the analysis and design of MIW that is currently being developed within the theoretical framework of Action Theory and the Action Facilitation Approach. The focus of the method is on the “within-job” level, dealing with features of the actual performed work behaviour within its environment. The overall architectural level of jobs is taken into account as well. Criteria for the evaluation of work activity are defined on both levels. The method is developed in co-operation with field experts on the analysis and design of work.
