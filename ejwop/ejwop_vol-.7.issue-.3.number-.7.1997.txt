Based on knowledge about individual stress, identity, and psychological dynamics in crisis situations, social responsibility in downsizing is discussed. The concepts of ethics and perceived fairness are discussed, based on four case studies. The richness of the empirical situations points to a need for a holistic view on downsizing and social responsibility, covering individual as well as organizational aspects. Taking interactional justice into account together with a more critical view of the principles used is suggested. Finally, the idea of time and timing is elaborated in relation to justice.
