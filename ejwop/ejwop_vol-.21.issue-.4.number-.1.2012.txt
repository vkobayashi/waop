This diary study tests the broaden-and-build theory in the work context and expands it by examining job resources as potential antecedents of positive emotions on a daily basis. We hypothesized that general perceptions of job resources (autonomy, supervisory coaching, and the psychological climate of cooperation and warmth) relate indirectly to employees' daily personal resources (self-efficacy, self-esteem, and optimism) through daily manifestations of the job resources and daily positive emotions. Forty-two employees completed first a questionnaire and then a diary survey over 5 consecutive workdays. In line with predictions, results of multilevel analyses revealed that general perceptions of job resources related positively to daily job resources. In addition, positive emotions mediated the relationship between daily job resources (autonomy and psychological climate of cooperation and warmth) and daily personal resources. Finally, general perceptions of the three job resources had an indirect effect on daily personal resources through the respective daily job resources and daily positive emotions. These findings provide important insights for organizations aiming at happy and flourishing workforces.
