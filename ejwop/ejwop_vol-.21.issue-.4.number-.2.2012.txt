Vallerand et al. (2003) developed a Dualistic Model of Passion where two types of passion are proposed: harmonious and obsessive passion. They generally predict adaptive and less adaptive outcomes, respectively. We hypothesized that the type of passion one holds towards his/her work should influence one's experience of burnout symptoms. We hypothesized that a harmonious passion for work would lead to low levels of burnout through its facilitation of frequent flow experiences, whereas an obsessive passion would directly lead to high levels of burnout. Two studies (one cross-sectional and one prospective) were conducted and results of structural equation modelling analyses supported the hypotheses.
