This article deals with two major types of instrument used to measure internal and external causal explanations in the work environment: locus of control scales and internality questionnaires. The first part of the article is devoted to the differences between these two types of instrument. Locus of control scales are derived from a differentialist approach and are designed to detect individual response consistency and style. Internality questionnaires stem from a socionormative perspective and are designed to reveal the existence of a normative partiality for internal explanations in a given population. The second part of the article examines some of the existing work-related locus of control scales and internality questionnaires.
