A consideration of the changes driving the move towards flexibility forces us to broaden our conception of what flexibility actually means. Two such drivers are the shift away from jobs-based work structures, and the re-engineering of business processes as more attention is paid to quality, service, cost, and time. As a consequence, employees are now expected to work smarter across areas of operational knowledge, collaborate more effectively with others, deal more with customers, and solve more problems. The implication is that flexibility of contract has to be accompanied by a range of other flexibilities if business needs are to be met.
