The current study focused how individual contract preference among female agency "temps" was related to perceptions of the job, and to somatic complaints and distress and quitting. The effort reward model by (Siegrist, 1996) was used as a general, theoretical framework guiding the choice of relevant job features. The mediating role of job perceptions on the relationship between contract preference and the outcomes was tested, controlling for several possible confounding factors. Data came from questionnaires, answered by 227 female employees, together with records of turnover provided by the employing agency. Results supported a model where contract preferences appeared to be negatively related to both health outcomes, and the relation was mediated by perceptions of work load and social support. Contract preferences were strongly related to intentions to quit, but not to actually leaving the job within 6 months.
