This article reports novel empirical findings on the conduct and behaviour of the boards and directors of the top 500 UK firms by capital employed. The particular focus of the article is the relative power and influence of part-time board members (chairmen and non-executive directors) compared with full-time board members (chief executive officers and executive directors). The empirical data are interpreted by a four-part conceptual framework examining the interactive effects of context, structure, power sources, and will and skill in using power to deliver intended effects. The conceptual approach to power is illustrated by two case examples of the mobilization of power to dismiss board members with the greatest positional power.
