There are common traditions in investigations into industrial stress and other kinds of poor workers' states in Western and Russian/Soviet applied psychology. Based upon these traditions we attempt to overview the main domains of research and possibilities for their application in a practical sense. Proposed psychodiagnostic and psychoprophylactic approaches have to be developed according to different kinds of work situations and technological progress. But the intention of basing research on the analysis of structural mechanisms of activity regulation seems to us the most productive in all of these cases. It corresponds to the increasing demands on human internal resources and mental activities in modern technological systems.
