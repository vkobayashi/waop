This article presents a series of meta-analyses carried out, exploring the construct validity of personnel selection interviews. Accordingly, the interviews were divided into two different groups: conventional interviews and behavior interviews. Conventional interviews are typically composed of questions directed at checking credentials, description of experience, and self-evaluative information. Behavior interviews mainly include questions concerning job knowledge, job experience, and behavior descriptions. The results showed that conventional interviews assessed general mental ability, job experience, the Big Five personality dimensions, and social skills, whereas behavior interviews mainly assessed job knowledge, job experience, situational judgment, and social skills. According to these findings, conventional and behavior interviews seem to be different interviews.
