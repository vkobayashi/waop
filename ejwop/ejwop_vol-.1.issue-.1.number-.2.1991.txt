The utilization of social science and in particular of applied psychology is a complex process, beset with obstacles. Five approaches to gathering knowledge are described and a conceptually important distinction is made between Action-Research and Research-Action. The paper analyses a number of obstacles to utilization from the point of view of the research community, the potential user and the academic institutions which support the work. Evidence in relation to five barriers to application is used to identify a tentative model of underutilization.
