Adopting a narrative view of organization, this article asks, “how do we know when an organization is working well?” A typical answer refers to the “bottom line” which, today, is a ubiquitous criterion even among government and other non-business organizations. The rhetoric of the bottom line is a privileging narrative that stipulates that only the views of experts are relevant to organizing and to assessing the “goodness” of organizations. Arguing that the metaphor of a learning organization reflects a social constructionist approach to organizing, the article explains how and why this notion represents a fundamental challenge to conventional management thinking and to the rhetoric of the bottom line. Organizing involves numerous and varied groups and is grounded in their conversations. Thus, community and relationships are integral to good organization. The difference between bottom-line and learning narratives, in terms of what makes good organization, involves different sets of values. It is difficult to reconcile the two narratives and to envisage an approach to managing that gives equal weight to profitability and to learning.
