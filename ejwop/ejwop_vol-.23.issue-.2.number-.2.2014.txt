Negative spillover from work into private life has often been found to be a mediator between work characteristics and health complaints. This study examined whether this mediator role can also be found when work characteristics are measured independently of job incumbents, i.e., when self-reported bias can be ruled out as a likely alternative explanation of the findings. Multiple mediator models in a heterogeneous sample of 517 employees from three occupational sectors were tested. Job demand and job control, both self-reported by job incumbents, and assessed by job analysis experts via a standardized observational interview, were measured as job characteristics. As hypothesized, the relations between expert-rated job characteristics and vital exhaustion are mediated by both, self-reported job characteristics and negative spillover. However, whereas expert-rated job demands have an impact on negative spillover and vital exhaustion without being perceived, the perception of job control plays a crucial role for the relations between expert-rated job control, negative spillover, and vital exhaustion. Altogether, we demonstrate that the strong relations between job characteristics, negative spillover, and vital exhaustion are not merely a consequence of biased subjective perception, but are rooted in the “real” job environment.
