This article explores the nature of expertise of HR developers who work on training, career development, and developmental processes in an organization. The study draws on the data from a survey on HR developers in Finland (n = 164), possessing both quality and length of education and experience typical of experts in HRD. The HR developers evaluated their work performance through work roles and outputs, importance of competencies needed in performance, and related developmental interests in competencies. The results indicated that in terms of work performance there are specific areas of change agency, trainership, and management in HRD work determined mostly by contextual factors; there is also a common element which refers to dealing with the less explicit processes of change. Also, there seem to be common areas in expert knowledge, but the importance of these varies according to work role. In terms of importance and developmental interest, analytical and coaching competence seemed to be central. Seemingly both are less explicit and informal areas of expert knowledge. Additionally, both are acquired mainly through experience, and are areas which enable expertise to be communicated and mediated for the use of the organization. These findings are discussed further in relation to the nature and further development of HR developer's expertise.
