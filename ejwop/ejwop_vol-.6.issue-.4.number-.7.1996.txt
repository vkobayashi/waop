Within stated limits, the paper explores the leadership and power-sharing role of boards of directors and top managers of joint stock companies in relation to a stakeholder concept. To whom is the top leadership group responsible and accountable? The paper examines this controversial question in relation to three stakeholder groups: owners of shares, employees below the top leadership, and customers. The answer to this question can be discussed in relation to values, legal obligations or pragmatic claims of efficiency. Differences are observed between the views of Anglo-American and continental countries, with the latter taking a broader stakeholder perspective and giving more emphasis to the role of law. Empirical evidence is presented relating to the impact of legal and formal structures and other conditions supporting leadership practices for sharing power with employees as stakeholders. The possibility for customers to exercise influence is more limited, except through the mechanism of the market. It is too early to judge whether the stakeholder concept will succeed in changing top-level leadership values and behaviour that previous power distribution concepts have not achieved.
