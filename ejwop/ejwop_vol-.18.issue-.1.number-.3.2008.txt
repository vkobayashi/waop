This study investigated whether the relationships between positive (PA) and negative affect (NA) and job satisfaction (JS) differ as a function of the satisfaction measure being primarily affective or cognitive in nature. Subject matter experts classified JS measures as being primarily affective or cognitive. A series of meta-analyses involving between 17 and 63 primary studies revealed that PA, but not NA, correlated more strongly with affective JS measures. Analyses comparing specific measures suggest that the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire is most cognitive in nature and that the Faces scale is most affective. The results indicate that affect predicts, but is not synonymous with, affective assessments of satisfaction. Discussion focuses on the discrepant mechanisms through which PA and NA may impact satisfaction.
