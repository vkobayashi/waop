Burnout syndrome has been described by different authors as a reaction to work stress. Hence both the role stress components–role ambiguity and role conflict–appear in the literature as burnout antecedent variables. The correlation between these variables is positive. On the other hand, the work social support (from supervisors and colleagues) is a variable with influence on both role stress and burnout, so the people who perceive higher work social support feel lower role stress and lower burnout than the people who perceive lower social support. In this study we present the results of a correlational study of role ambiguity, role conflict, burnout levels (tested with Maslach Burnout Inventory), and the work social support effects on the relations. The sample are 102 nursing professionals, 24 per cent males and 76 per cent females. The results present a positive correlation between both role ambiguity and role conflict, and the emotional exhaustion scale and depersonalization scale, and a negative correlation between both role conflict and role ambiguity, and reduced personal accomplishment and work social support influence on the relations.
