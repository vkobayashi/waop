Few studies investigated the assumed positive effects of autonomous groups on individual psychological well-being. In the present study we investigated the hypotheses that (1) group autonomy is positively related to psychological well-being, (2) this relationship is mediated by individual autonomy, individual task variety, individual workload, and social support. One hundred and thirty-eight members of autonomous teams in a supermarket chain completed questionnaires about their task perceptions and psychological well-being. The hypotheses were largely supported by structural equations analyses. Results are discussed and implications proposed.
