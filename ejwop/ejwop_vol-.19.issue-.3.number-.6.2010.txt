Researchers in the field of leadership have shown an increasing interest in examining the additional effect of consensus, which reflects on the variability of leadership perceptions in a team on outcomes. Based on theoretical assumptions with regard to social group processes and group-related mechanisms of transformational leadership it is hypothesized in this study that besides group-level transformational leadership, the consensus among group members will positively predict affective and normative commitment. In contrast, no relationship with continuance commitment was expected. Further we proposed that the influence of group-level transformational leadership is mediated by perceptions of meaningful tasks, whereas consensus is mediated by positive organizational climate. Multisource data were collected from 21 CEOs of small pharmacies and their subordinates. Subordinates (N = 105) rated their supervisors' transformational leadership, as well as their individual perceptions of task content, organizational climate, and organizational commitment, and CEOs rated their scope of influence. As expected, group-level transformational leadership and consensus were positively related to affective commitment. Further multilevel analyses revealed that meaningful task content mediated the influence of leadership on affective commitment. Positive organizational climate slightly mediated the relationship between consensus and affective commitment. Practical implications are discussed with regard to commitment management by promoting meaningful work and strengthening consensus and climate.
