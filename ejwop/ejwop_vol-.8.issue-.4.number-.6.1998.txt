A survey was conducted using a convenient sample of employees (N = 999) from various industries to examine the main and combined effects of organizational and individual values on organizational commitment, perceived organizational support, and procedural justice. Moderated multiple regression analyses showed that employees' reactions were mainly explained by perceived organizational values and value preferences. In contrast, person-organization value fit and interaction effects were marginal. The implications of these findings are discussed.
