A self-completion questionnaire survey of coping behaviours and associated perceptions amongst 675 white collar public sector employees is reported. In addition to identifying underlying dimensions of coping behaviour, the relationship between reported use of coping strategies and perceptions related to work stress, general mental well-being, and job satisfaction were explored. From the responses concerning frequency of use of various coping methods, five dimensions of coping strategy were identified: problem-focused, health and leisure-oriented, social support seeking, avoidant, and formal relaxation. It was found that use of avoidant coping methods was significantly associated with perceived problems with coping at work, with lower job satisfaction, and with poorer levels of general mental health. Higher reported use of problem-focused methods was significantly associated with fewer problems with coping at work, higher job satisfaction, and better levels of general mental health.
