Based on his experience as an academic, consultant, and manager, the author comments on the shifts of perspective he perceives in the current theory and practice of leadership. The major shifts of perspective may be described as shifting from: looking at leaders as individuals to teams taking leadership roles; taking the perspective of top executives to taking the perspective of co-workers and combining both to a commonly construed view; integrating soft factors and financial aspects into a more complex understanding of business; expanding the scope from companies to the environment and the fit into value chains of industries and the surrounding societies and cultures; and from orientation to the past to actively creating and shaping the future.
