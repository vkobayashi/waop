European research in Work and Organizational Psychology traditionally has a phenomenological orientation, favours comprehensive models, and stresses the role of individuals and situational factors in the work process. This means that individual characteristics of employees and the notion of cognitive regulation within situations have a prominent place. In this study, we used a framework that incorporates both these aspects as determinants of work behaviour (Roe & Zijlstra, 199157.

Based on survey data from 406 hospital employees, we tested a model that specified organizational citizenship behaviour as a mediator of relationships between individual factors (psychological climate and self-efficacy) and work outcomes (quality of performance and emotional exhaustion). The results demonstrated support for our hypothesized model of how work behaviour mediates the relationship between these antecedents and outcomes. Practical implications and future research directions are discussed.
