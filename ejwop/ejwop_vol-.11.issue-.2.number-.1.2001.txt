The implications of social identification for work motivation and other workrelated attitudes and behaviours are discussed. Based on assumptions from social identity theory and self-categorization theory, it is proposed that an increase in social identification or social identity salience will be associated with improvement in those aspects of work motivation, work satisfaction, and other behaviours of group members that are in accordance with in-group norms. In addition, the theories suggest a distinction between different dimensions (e.g., cognitive, affective) and different foci (e.g., work group, occupational group) of identification. Results from two correlational studies with school teachers as participants (N s = 201, 283) test and support the proposed ideas.
