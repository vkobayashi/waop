Using data from 68 organizations embedded within 14 nations, we examined hypotheses concerning the moderating roles of national culture and organizational climate on the transfer of training to the work context. A dimension of national culture, uncertainty avoidance, moderated the transfer of safety training with regard to reducing accidents and injuries; and organizational safety climate moderated the transfer of safety training with respect to both engaging in safe work behaviour and reducing accidents and injuries. Along with discussing the implications of a positive safety climate, we discuss how the tendency within a culture to avoid uncertainty may paradoxically lead to greater uncertainty and negative consequences in relation to the transfer of safety training.
