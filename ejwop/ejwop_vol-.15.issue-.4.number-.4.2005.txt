The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a participative work conference based on democratic dialogue on the employee's psychosocial work environment (job control, work climate, clarity of work goals, flow of information, and support from supervisor) and well-being (emotional exhaustion and stress symptoms). The study group was male-dominated (80%) and was mostly employed in manual tasks (86%) in a municipal public works department. Pre- and postmeasurements were carried out through a questionnaire with a 2-year interval. In addition, the experiences of participating in the intervention and the perceived changes due to the intervention were examined through thematic group interviews. The intervention group (n = 253 from Department A) participated in two-and-a-half-day participative work conferences. Two control groups were applied: (1) n = 107 from Department A; (2) n = 165 from Department B. The intervention had a positive effect on the work climate and flow of information in the intervention group compared with Control group 2 after controlling for age, gender, type of work, basic education, and participation in other interventions. The intervention did not, however, have an effect on individual well-being. According to the interviews, the work climate became more open and participative regardless of some negative experiences in participating in the conferences.
