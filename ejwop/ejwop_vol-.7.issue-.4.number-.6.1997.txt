This study examined whether peer nominations of high performers can be explained by the likeability of these persons. Analysis of performance and likeability ratings provided by 123 software professionals for high and average performing co-workers showed that likeability and performance ratings were positively related, but nevertheless represented to different constructs. Likeability and performance of co-workers nominated as high performers were rated higher than likeability and performance of average performing co-workers. Differences in performance ratings remained stable when taking likeability into account as a covariate. The findings suggest that peer nomination outcomes may not be reduced to likeability and that peer nominations can be regarded as one suitable method for identifying high performers within expertise research.
