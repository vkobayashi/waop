The aim of this study is to examine the influence of the sources of psychological stress at work assumed by the Demand–Control–Support (DCS) model on presenteeism propensity. Research propositions are derived from the dynamic version of the Demand–Control model, to which we added the dimension of social support, which is part of the DCS model. Data were obtained from a large representative sample consisting of 1609 public and private sector workers living in the Canadian province of Québec, who responded to a questionnaire, administered using computer-assisted interviewing over a 3-month period in 2007–2008. The results indicate that the combination of low decision authority and high supervisor's support attenuates the positive relationship between job demands and presenteeism propensity within a 10-year time frame of exposure to a new job.
