The scant research on the use of groups of assessors in selection processes indicates that group discussion in assessment centres and panel interviews results in little or no increase in predictive validity. Yet social psychological research suggests that there should be benefits from working in groups on such tasks.However, it also suggests reasons why such benefits might not be realized in practice, which derive from issues of conformity and identity. It is argued that these issues are often present in selection processes. Some hypotheses for research and some ways of redesigning processes to take account of them are presented. It is proposed that different ways of working in groups are appropriate for the different purposes that selection may be serving.
