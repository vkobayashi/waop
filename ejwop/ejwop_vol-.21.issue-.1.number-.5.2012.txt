The recently introduced concept of job embeddedness has been shown to predict various organizational outcomes. In prediction models, its usual role is that of an antecedent explaining variance beyond commonly used attitudinal measures. Using social information processing theory as a framework, the present study examines on-the-job embeddedness (ONJE) as a potential mediator in predicting performance within an educational framework. Analysis of a multisource evaluation scheme applied to 115 school teachers supported the expectation that conscientiousness and ONJE are predictors of task and contextual performance. Moreover, ONJE was found to serve as a mediator by providing a partial explanation for the link between conscientiousness and contextual performance. Future research with other attitudinal and personality measures is suggested to broaden the role that ONJE plays in predicting performance.
