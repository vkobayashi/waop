An analysis is presented of how group representatives develop a collaborative task-system and cope with a number of diversity issues in the intergroup task: heterogeneity of group membership and social identity, diversity of interests and resources. The data were obtained during a three-day training and simulation course in which a number of international consultants, taking the roles of the relevant interest parties, developed a collaborative task-system in order to deal with the economic deterioration of an island in the area of St Petersburg, Russia. Observations are provided on how the representatives, lacking pre-established roles and procedures, coped with the convener role, developed the domain of collaboration, and managed the interest and contributions of the different parties. Evidence suggests that, without proper training, participants converge around the vision of an ideal future state, but, being unable to cope effectively with differences, leave the realization of action to bilateral negotiation.
