Corporate citizenship presented by a business organization is important for eventually improving its employees' anticipations about their responsibilities in an employment exchange relationship with the organization (i.e., psychological contracts). This study examines both direct and indirect effects of perceived corporate citizenship on psychological contracts and their key mediator. In the proposed model herein, transactional and relational contracts are affected by four dimensions of perceived corporate citizenship directly and indirectly through the mediation of job self-efficacy. Empirical testing using a survey of personnel from 20 high-tech corporations fully or partially supports eight of our nine hypothesized model paths. Finally, managerial implications and limitations of our findings are discussed.
