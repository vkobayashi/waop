In this commentary, I address the wider context of work engagement research including the conflicting interests of employees on the one hand and managers and shareholders on the other, exchange relationships in the workplace, and the economic instrumentality of work in people's lives.

Additionally, I suggest that the costs of high work engagement for employees deserve far greater attention than they have received to date and question to what extent high engagement is always such a positive experience for employees. Lastly, I suggest that a potential benefit of high engagement is that more of people's essential humanity is involved in their work. In this regard, I urge researchers to take into account automaticity and the role of nonconscious processes.
