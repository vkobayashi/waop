In this article, we investigate the effects of leader emotional expressiveness on idealized influence and leadership effectiveness. Drawing from recent theory and research on authentic leadership, we also examine the moderating role of leader behavioural and relational authenticity in the relationship between leader emotional expressiveness and idealized influence. Results obtained in a study of 198 mid-level managers largely supported our predictions, in that leader emotional expressiveness was positively associated with followers' extra effort and their perceptions of leadership effectiveness. These effects were fully mediated by idealized influence. Consistent with the notion of authentic leadership as a root concept for other positive leadership approaches, the effect of emotional expressiveness on idealized influence was moderated by leader relational authenticity such that only those leaders who were emotionally expressive and relationally authentic were perceived to have high idealized influence.
