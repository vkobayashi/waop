The issue of the “glass ceiling” effect on gender differences in upper level management was addressed. Three different explanations of the gender difference in participating at upper level management were tested, and designated as the Stereotype theory, the Experience theory, and the Personality theory. The first claims the “glass ceiling” effect to be a genuine phenomenon, while the two latter ones disclaim the concept in favour of alternative interpretations. 553 surveys (405 males and 148 females) at different managerial levels responded to a questionnaire measuring adaptor vs. innovator orientations in problem solving. Results show a significant interaction between gender and managerial level on innovation-oriented problem solving, where females at the executive level exhibit a strikingly higher innovator score than their male colleagues. The results are taken as support for the Stereotype theory. Finally, some limitations of the present study are pointed out, and suggestions for further studies are made.
