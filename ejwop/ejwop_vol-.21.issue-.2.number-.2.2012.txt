New career patterns and shifting psychological contracts pose new challenges to organizations and their career management practices. This study examines the need for an individualized approach to career management, taking into account the changing conditions of careers. Therefore, the hypotheses that “new” versus traditional types of career orientation moderate the relationship between breach of psychological contract and work attitudes were tested. Specifically, it was predicted that the relationships between breach of particular contents of psychological contracts and work attitudes are moderated by three distinct types of career orientation (independent, traditional/promotion, traditional/loyalty). Results confirmed that differential relationships do exist between breach of contract contents, individual career orientation, and work attitudes. As hypothesized, disengaged career-oriented employees did not react to any particular content breach. Thus, career orientations relate to the magnitude and the type of employee response after breach of particular contract contents. When managing employment relationships by providing human resource and career management practices, managers and human resource professionals should take into account the employee's individual career orientation.
