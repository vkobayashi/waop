In our response to the lead article (Bakker, Leiter, & Albrecht, 2011 this issue), we focus on five conceptual issues in order to better catch the slippery concept of work engagement: (1) “What's in the name” of engagement? (2)What is its relationship with burnout? (3) How to differentiate work engagement from task engagement? (4) How to distinguish between collective and individual work engagement? (5) What are the dark sides of work engagement? In doing so, we hope to contribute to a better conceptualization of work engagement and to a more fruitful future research agenda.
