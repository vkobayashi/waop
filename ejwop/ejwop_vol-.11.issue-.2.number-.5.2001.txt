Three studies on occupational self-efficacy are presented. In the first study, a scale of occupational self-efficacy is developed and set in relation to several personality constructs (general self-efficacy, self-esteem, internal control beliefs, and neuroticism). The correlations found are in the expected direction and of the expected size. In a second and third study, results on the relation to task demands, leader-member exchange (that is quality of exchange between a leader and his/her subordinates), job satisfaction, and to commitment (third study) are reported and were all found to be positive and significant. In addition, occupational selfefficacy can be shown to have some incremental validity in predicting job satisfaction beyond core self-evaluation constructs. In general, occupational selfefficacy can be recommended as a reliable, one-dimensional construct. Its relations to personality constructs and organizational variables show acceptable construct and criterion validity. Implications for practical use of the instrument are discussed.
