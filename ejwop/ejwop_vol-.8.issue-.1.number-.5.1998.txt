This article shows how the classic research paradigm of role-playing and attitude change (e.g. Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959), can better be used to demonstrate how the structural relation between leader and follower (i.e. between experimenter and subject) influences the follower's evaluation of work (i.e. of the subject's evaluation of the experimental task), than to demonstrate how the content of the played role influences the subsequent attitude of the subject. This is done by a gradual unmasking of the attitudinal approach as a rhetorical device, and by showing step by step how the structural approach is more powerful to explain the results. The final conclusion is that free role-playing is actually an implementation of the subject's a priori desire to collaborate with the leader (i.e. the experimenter) and which, via the co-ownership of work that it creates, induces a less negative and eventually even a more positive attitude towards the experimental work that needs to be done (or towards work-related aspects of the institution in which that work needs to be done).
