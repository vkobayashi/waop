The development and validation of the Virtual Team Competency Inventory (VTCI), an Internet-based measure for selection and placement of members in virtual teams, is described. Item selection was based on a conceptual model with three main categories (taskwork, teamwork, and telecooperation related KSAs) and 11 subscales. After an exploratory pilot study with 169 undergraduate students, 39 items remained in the final version of the VTCI. In the main study, 258 members of organizational virtual teams completed the VTCI and were concurrently assessed by their team managers. The results showed satisfactory reliability of the VTCI (overall alpha = .92) and good convergent and discriminant validity. The concurrent multiple validity of the VTCI was .49 for individual team members' performance. Moreover, analyses at the team-level revealed significant correlations between team effectiveness and mean, minimum (but not maximum), and variance aggregations of VTCI predictors within the teams.
