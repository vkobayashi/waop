In this article, we review recent methodological developments that have enabled conceptual advances addressing intraindividual processes leading to psychological well-being. We contend that the introduction of dynamic assessment methodologies for sampling experiences, feelings, and behaviours on and off the job, together with the implementation of multilevel modelling strategies in organizational research on well-being, should lead to the development of richer models of employee well-being (compared to existing theoretical models). Accordingly, we develop a model of employee well-being that considers both personal and situational predictors, and both work and nonwork well-being indicators, as well as the real-time relationships between well-being antecedents and indicators across these two life spheres.
