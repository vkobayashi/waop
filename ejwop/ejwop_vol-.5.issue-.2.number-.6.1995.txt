The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between mobbing at work and the well-being of the affected person, and to explore possible organizational effects of mobbing in connection with coping behaviour. The article reports data from two studies carried out in Austria (368 health professionals) and Germany (10 in-patients) between 1993 and 1994. The results support other findings that mobbing has a negative impact on the well-being of the affected person. Moreover, the results indicate that employees do not cope with mobbing by using simple flight or fight reactions (e.g. absenteeism, lower level of productivity). The results suggest that it should be possible to identify mobbing in an early stage, which, in turn, should enhance the prevention of mobbing.
