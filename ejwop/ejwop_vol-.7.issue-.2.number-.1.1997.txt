This article offers a framework for understanding power dynamics and organizational change. We use five perspectives to explore the relationships between change approaches, the power used to effect changes, the agents involved in the change process, the most prominent change strategies and influence tactics, and the behavioural outcomes. The perspectives are related to different levels of analysis and contingency factors. New research questions are being raised about the scope and connection of the five perspectives, the institutionalization of power, the way power dynamics hinder organizational change, the will and skill to use power in change processes, and the power of communication and democratic dialogue in organizational learning.
