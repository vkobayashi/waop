Affective events theory proposes affective experiences at work to cause job satisfaction. Using multiple measurements obtained in a diary study, affective experiences in terms of state positive and state negative affect (PA, NA) were related to state job satisfaction (N = 91). Trait measures were also collected. Results confirmed our hypothesis. First, aggregated state job satisfaction is strongly correlated with trait job satisfaction. Second, the relationship between state affect and state job satisfaction is not spurious: State affect impacts on state job satisfaction even if trait affect and trait job satisfaction are controlled. Third, the effect of state affect on job satisfaction measured by the faces scale is stronger than the effect of state affect on job satisfaction measured by facet scales. It is concluded that not all scales to measure job satisfaction are equally appropriate to investigate affect at work.
