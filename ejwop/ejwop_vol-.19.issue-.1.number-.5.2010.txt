This study examined the interrelations between registered employee absenteeism, job satisfaction, and burnout in a longitudinal design with four yearly waves of data. The participants were 844 workers in 34 companies in The Netherlands. In line with the predictions, a reciprocal relationship between job satisfaction and absence frequency was found. Lower job satisfaction increased absence frequency in the following year, whereas higher absence frequency lowered subsequent job satisfaction. Contrary to the prediction, more time lost due to absence increased job satisfaction in the following year. Furthermore, it was found that higher burnout enhanced future time lost due to absence, and lowered future job satisfaction. Finally, individuals who were frequently absent in one year, were more likely to have a prolonged absence in the following year.
