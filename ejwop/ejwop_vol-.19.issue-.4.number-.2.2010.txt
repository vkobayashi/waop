This experiment investigated how individuals adapt to increased work autonomy and examined the moderating role of task reflection. Work autonomy was manipulated in an experimental setting in which participants (n = 56) completed a scheduling task. Multilevel analyses demonstrated that participants who began work with low autonomy showed poorer performance when autonomy was increased compared to participants who began with a high level of autonomy. Analysis of thinking-aloud protocols revealed that reflection about task accomplishment had a negative impact on performance among those individuals who worked previously with low autonomy. The data suggest that cognitive capacity limitations and prior task-related knowledge led to the detrimental effects of task reflection on performance when experiencing low autonomy.
