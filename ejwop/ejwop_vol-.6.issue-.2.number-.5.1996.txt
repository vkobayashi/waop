An experiment is reported in which the effect of sex composition on the creativity of brainstorming groups is investigated. It was hypothesized that mixed sex groups would be more creative than either homogeneous male or homogeneous female groups. Fifteen groups, consisting of four members each two males and two females; four females; four males, took part in the experiment. The experimenter noted the number of ideas generated per person, as well as the different associations with these ideas, and the number of different angles from which the task was approached. After finishing the exercise, subjects completed a post-experimental questionnaire. Results show that heterogeneous groups produced more creative outcomes than homogeneous groups. Also, they rated their process more positively. These findings are discussed in relation to the type of task used, and in relation to the general notion that heterogeneous groups are likely to produce more creative outcomes yet suffer from more process problems as compared to homogeneous groups.
