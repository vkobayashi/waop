The aim of the study was to compare and analyse differences in work conditions and health between workers in permanent and temporary employment. The study group consisted of a representative, stratified sample of the Swedish working population (n = 2767). The data support the main hypothesis of the study, i.e., that temporary employed differ from permanent employed in control over their working life. With some exceptions, there were clear differences between these two categories with respect to a number of variables that can be regarded as central to both the individual's success at work and protection against job loss and exclusion from working life. Health differences were in favour of the permanent employed. There were also considerable differences between different sub-groups of temporary employees of such amplitude and consistency that they formed a distinct centre-periphery structure.
