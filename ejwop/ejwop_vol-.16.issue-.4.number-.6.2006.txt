What are the antecedents of counterproductive behaviour (CB) at work? Previous research identified both trait and perceived situational variables such as dispositional self-control and organizational justice. In this article, the focus is on employees' perceived job demands. More specifically, the relation between emotional labour (surface and deep acting) and CB is examined. An online study with service providers from different lines of business (N = 559) confirmed that, while controlling for dispositional self-control and organizational injustice, both surface and deep acting in customer interactions were related to CB at work. Whereas the most influential variable was dispositional self-control, the findings confirm that people's perceived job demands contribute to deviant behaviour at work. Practical implications for job design are discussed.
