The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of brief problem-solving training for improving adjustment in individuals who have low control over their work environment. The 118 participants were flight attendants who were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The results indicated that when compared to the control group, those who received the problem-solving skills training reported at postintervention more problem-solving skills, more problem-solving self-efficacy, greater positive affect, higher job satisfaction, and higher life satisfaction. To assess whether improvements were due to experimenter demand, participants completed a measure of openness, which the intervention was not expected to affect. No difference in groups occurred for openness. The results provide evidence that problem-solving training can help improve adjustment in individuals working in low-control environments.
