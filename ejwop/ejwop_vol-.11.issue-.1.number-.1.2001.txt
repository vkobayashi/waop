The aim of the present study is to test the moderating role of levels of self-efficacy specificity (i.e., generalized and computer self-efficacy) in the Job Demand-Control (JD-C) Model, and its effects on burnout (i.e., exhaustion and cynicism). Previous research on Karasek's model failed to corroborate the demand control interaction effect on different strain variables. In order to refine and extend the JD-C model, we propose a specific measure for job demands (i.e., quantitative overload) as well as for job control (i.e. method and time control). Furthermore, research on self-efficacy beliefs shows that the more specific the self-efficacy beliefs, the more predictive they are. In the current study, two levels of self-efficacy beliefs are introduced as moderators (i.e., generalized and computer self-efficacy). Based on data collected from 405 workers using information technology in their jobs, the expected Job Demand Control Interaction effect was found in both burnout dimensions (i.e., exhaustion and cynicism) as predicted by the JD-C model. In addition, the more specific level of self-efficacy (i.e., computer self-efficacy) moderated the relationship between job demands and control and levels of burnout dimensions as expected. Limitations of the study and its practical implications are discussed.
