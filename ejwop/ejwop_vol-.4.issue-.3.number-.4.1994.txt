Human resource management (HRM) is largely American in origin and carries with it a distinctive unitarist and individualist focus. This paper shows how this approach to HRM draws heavily on the work of American organizational psychologists. It argues that we should take HRM seriously, but that, in the context of Europe, a rather different focus is required. The elements of a European approach to HRM are presented. It is suggested that the approach fits well with some of the work of European work and organizational psychologists, but that they must adopt a wider perspective if they are to make a distinctive contribution to the success of HRM.
