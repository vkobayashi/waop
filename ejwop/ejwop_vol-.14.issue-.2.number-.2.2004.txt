A field study involving a healthcare institution was conducted, to examine the mediating influence of conflict responses on the relation between conflict and well-being. We tested the hypothesis that conflict at work and its responses resulted in the experience of more organizational stress and therefore in reduced well-being. Using structural equation modelling we found support for our hypotheses. We not only showed that conflict was positively related to helplessness and flight behaviour, but also that these responses mediated between conflict and organizational stress. Finally, increases in experienced organizational stress reduced well-being. Implications for conflict theory and well-being in organizations are discussed.
