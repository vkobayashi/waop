Theories of transformational and charismatic leadership provide important insights about the nature of effective leadership, but most of the theories have weaknesses in the conceptualization and measurement of leadership processes. The limitations include use of simplistic two-factor models, omission of relevant behaviours, focus on dyadic processes, assumption of heroic leadership, and overreliance on weak methods. I discuss these weaknesses and present results from a study on leader behaviour dimensions to clarify some of my concerns.
