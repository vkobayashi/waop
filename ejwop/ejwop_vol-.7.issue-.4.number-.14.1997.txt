The example of the Opel high potential selection process indicates that special training programmes that clarify the role and the tasks of supervisors within the selection process are worthwhile. These training programmes help to familiarize supervisors with the standardized assessment forms used in the selection process and to improve their assessment skills. A pilot study with a new training programme showed positive effects. The training ensured high transparency of the whole high potential selection process. The supervisors reported that the training programme had made them more sensitive to the issues of personnel selection and personnel development. On the whole, the quality of the high potential selection process and the accuracy of the assessments could be increased. Furthermore, when supervisory training was completed, supervisors were able to give more detailed and structured feedback information to their employees about their performance behaviour.
