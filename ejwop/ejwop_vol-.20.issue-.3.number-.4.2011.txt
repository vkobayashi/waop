In the present study, the construct validity of a revised edition of the Belbin Team Roles measure is tested. This edition consists of three parts to determine someone's team roles. The sample included 1434 persons who were asked to fill out the self-perception inventory and the self-perception assessment sheet, and the Observer Assessment Sheet was filled out by at least four observers. The interrater agreement of the Observer Assessment Sheet was satisfactory across all team roles. As for the construct validity, which was studied in a multitrait–multimethod design using structural equation modelling, the results revealed that the discriminant and convergent validity for the instrument as a whole is good; a small effect could be contributed to method variance.
