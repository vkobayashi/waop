The purpose of the present study was to examine Hackman and Oldham's job characteristics model in predicting voluntary employee turnover. Using a sample of 120 production workers, the study provided some support for the model's most demanding assumption of a moderating effect of growth need strength on the job characteristics-turnover relationship. In addition, some direct associations were also found. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed and some suggestions are given.
