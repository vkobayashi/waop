Modern organizations are often faced with the problem of communication and co-ordination over large distances. Interaction technology such as electronic mail (e-mail) systems and videoconferencing are developed to cope with this problem. Work and organizational psychologists are challenged to provide theories and concepts for the analysis and design of these systems. A conceptual model is presented, which is based on building blocks from cognitive psychology, group dynamics, organizational communication theory, and media theory. A laboratory experiment framed on the basis of this model shows that certain problem-solving tasks can be performed equally well by mediated teams, even when they are supported only by an audio channel. Video-channels do not add much support for the task execution. However, the interaction situation has consequences for the interaction processes, i.e. mediated groups have to structure their interaction very clearly.
