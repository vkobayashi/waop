Job stressors at the occupational level have become a relevant issue in the field of stress research. Along these lines, the Healthy Work Organization model and the Job Demands–Control model have emphasized the relevance of job stressors defined as a collective construct such as time pressure. Nevertheless, empirical evidence on the potential negative outcomes associated with time pressure as a collective phenomenon and the mechanisms underlying these relationships is lacking. The Healthy Work Organization model posits work adjustment (e.g., job satisfaction) to be a potential mediating variable in the link between shared time pressure at the organizational level and poor health. This study examined the extent to which job satisfaction mediates this relationship in a sample of 367 professional drivers. Findings indicated that shared time pressure at the organizational level was negatively related to job satisfaction and self-reported health but not to sickness absence. Additionally, job satisfaction mediated the relationship between time pressure and self-reported health.
