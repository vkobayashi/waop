The present study investigated the value preferences of frontline workers and branch managers working in a large bank in Israel. Value preferences of bank workers (n = 98) were compared with those of a matching sample drawn from the Israeli general population (n = 152). In addition, value preferences of bank frontline workers were compared with those of bank branch managers and deputy managers. Finally, the relationships between personal value preferences and the workers’ career motivation were examined. The results indicate that compared to the general population, bank workers have a higher preference for conformity, hedonism, and power values and a lower preference for benevolence, universalism, and self-direction values. Compared to the frontline workers, the bank branch managers and deputy managers reported a higher preference for achievement values and a lower preference for tradition values. Higher career motivation was associated with a higher preference for achievement and power values and a lower preference for benevolence values.
