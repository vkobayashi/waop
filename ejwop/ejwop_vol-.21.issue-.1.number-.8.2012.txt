Training is considered an important HR practice relevant to employee work-related attitudes. In this study, we systematically investigated the connections between employees' perceptions of training—in terms of perceived training-related benefits, perceived supervisor support for training, and perceived access to training—and their three types of organizational commitment—continuance, affective, and normative. In addition, we further explored how employee self-construal—individual, relational, and collective self-construals—moderated these relationships. Data were collected from 152 employees in two Philippine organizations. The results showed that employees' perceptions of training were related to their commitment to the organization, and the strength of these associations was further moderated by employee self-construal. These findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical implications for human resource management.
