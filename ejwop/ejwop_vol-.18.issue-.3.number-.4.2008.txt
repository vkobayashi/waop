The present study examines the relation of self-leadership on team members' motivation, satisfaction, and performance in organizational teams. The mediating role of motivation processes was tested at the individual level. Moreover, the moderating effects of group-level variables, i.e., autonomy and task type, and intrateam processes, i.e., task and relationship conflicts, were analysed. Hierarchical linear modelling analyses showed that self-leadership is positively related to performance at the individual level and that this relationship is partially mediated by self-efficacy and instrumentality. Task conflicts and relationship conflicts were negatively related to performance. Autonomy and task type show no moderating effect on the self-leadership performance relation. Implications in terms of theoretical and practical managerial aspects are discussed.
