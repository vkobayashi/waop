By means of a qualitative study, the article examines the possible reasons for the apparent shortcomings and limited success of the Swedish statutory regulations against workplace bullying which pioneered and inspired statutory antibullying regulations in other countries following its enactment in 1993. Semistructured interviews were carried out with 18 participants, each with extensive knowledge and experience of the issue, representing employer and trade-union organizations, enforcement authorities, academia, and victim-support organizations. A range of potential reasons for its limited success emerged from the study, encompassing shortcomings associated with the involvement (or lack of involvement) of key actors—employers, trade unions, and labour inspectorate, and with the antibullying regulatory framework itself. In addition, some cultural and socioeconomic conditions may also have hampered its effectiveness and success. In light of these findings the study raises questions about how to regulate for intangible issues such as bullying. However, the Swedish Ordinance against bullying has contributed to giving the issue credibility. Yet, in order to be successful, legal interventions must be accompanied by well-informed, trained, and motivated employers and trade unions who, in collaboration, are willing to deal with the problem proactively on an organizational level as well as responding to individual cases when they occur, supported by an enforcement agency or inspectorate which is equipped and geared up for its role.
