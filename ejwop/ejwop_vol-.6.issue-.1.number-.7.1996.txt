The rapid and multiform evolution of socio-technical environments reported in recent research in work and organizational psychology Meaning of Work has led to a pressing need for the full understanding of increasingly complex phenomena and processes. In this article we attempt to show how explanation is linked to these evolutions, in its functions of analysis, management, and anticipation of the functioning of organizations. We take the view that explanation also constitutes, for each individual, a differentiated process of cognitive and identity regulation. By considering the modes of cognitive and temporal investment of salaried adults in training situations, we show how their behaviour depends on differentiated attributional styles, themselves a function of situational characteristics gender, professional domain, etc. According to certain theoretical and practical points of view, the acquisition and transfer of valued attributional styles, such as the norm of internality, constitute objectives to be favoured in order to optimize, for example, the strategies of professional integration of social actors. However, the variability of explanatory styles in relation to the life domains we refer to leads us to qualify very strongly these points of view.
