This paper discusses the relationships between the Productivity Measurement and Enhancement System ProMES and several context factors that have proven to be critical in the process of developing and implementing this system. The factors addressed are existing pay systems, supervisory behaviour, and the nature of group tasks combined with types of feedback and goals. On the basis of the results of some case studies it is argued that those factors need to show characteristics that are compatible with central characteristics of ProMES in order to promote the acceptance and effectiveness of the approach. Incompatible relations between ProMES and these factors may not only lead to an increase in experienced ambiguity and conflict at work, but may also disrupt group performance. The paper offers some examples on how to deal with such incompatible relations in practice so that the potentials of ProMES can be entirely realized.
