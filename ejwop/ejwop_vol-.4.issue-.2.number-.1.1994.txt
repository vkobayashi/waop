From the perspective of psychosocial stress, the period when young people are seeking their first job may be seen as a potential threat to self, which could activate sociocognitive and affective strategies for the maintenance or construction of a positive social identity. Our research has examined some of these strategies, highlighting social self-description as the product of comparison between self and social groups consisting of workers (relative deprivation) and unemployed people (self-enhancement). Our hypotheses are: (1) social self-description is a function of the quality of the social interactions of young unemployed people; and (2) the psychological consequences of unemployment (the severity of minor psychiatric disorders and the affective attitude towards the future) vary according to social self-description. These hypotheses were tested on two groups of young people in search of employment: 208 Italians (104 males and 104 females) aged between 17 and 19; 169 French (62 males and 107 females) aged between 16 and 26. Application of a structural equation (LISREL model) substantially confirmed both the hypotheses for the two sets of data.
