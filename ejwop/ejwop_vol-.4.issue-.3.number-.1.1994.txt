How will a future historian describe the social and economic developments of the 20th century? Writing a study on this will be a complex endeavour, taking into account the numerous aspects involved but, most likely, two developments will be central to such a study: the rise of scientific management in the beginning of the century and the search for new approaches at the end of the century. The last two decades of the 20th century are a kind of crisis situation, with Western organizations facing enormous competition in global markets, and finding it difficult to meet new demands. Organizations are forced to rethink organizational practices in order to meet such new demands, which often leads to major reorganization programmes, and large downsizing projects.
