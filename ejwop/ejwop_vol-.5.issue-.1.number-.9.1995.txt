Organizational innovation is approached as a joint conversational event where new configurations of meaning are constructed. The emphasis in this article is on understanding the social dynamic processes of creating new meaning. A perspectivistic approach is developed which looks at how actors speak from their perspectives and give form to the sense-making process through discursive practices. The innovation process is documented, using an interpretive research, in two case studies: the creation of a young high tech firm and the internal development of a manufacturing unit of a multinational corporation. Three theoretical propositions derived from the cases are discussed and interwoven with existing literature: generative characteristics of conversations, the experiential profundity which can be seen as inherently social-relational, and the paradoxical nature of innovation. These propositions are summarized in conceptual charts; their use lies in multiplying and developing them into new ones as new contexts are explored.
