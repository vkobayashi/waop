The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that male assistant nurses, representing a small gender minority in their profession and in the work organizations they inhabit, are more often exposed to bullying at work than their female colleagues. In 1999, a random sample of the assistant nurses organized in the Norwegian Union of Health and Social Workers were mailed a questionnaire; 7478 out of 12,000 (62.3%) completed the questionnaire. The sample of the present study comprised the 6485 respondents who were vocationally active and not on leave. 3.8% (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>247) of the respondents were men; 10.2% (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>25) of the men and 4.3% (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>265) of the women reported that they had been exposed to bullying at work during the previous 6 months, <U+03C7>2<U+200A>=<U+200A>19.12, df<U+200A>=<U+200A>1, p<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>.0001. The association between gender and exposure to bullying at work remained strong and significant (odds ratio<U+200A>=<U+200A>2.29; 95% confidence interval<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.39<U+200A>-<U+200A>3.78; p<U+200A>=<U+200A>.001) even after adjustment for a series of background factors. The study supports the hypothesis that male assistant nurses are more often exposed to bullying at work than their female colleagues.
