This article describes a study into the needs and behavioural reaction patterns in a sample of 715 workers in Bulgarian industrial firms during the “post-Socialist” period. The findings from this study cast doubt on some popular views of the typical motivation and reactions to work in the former “Socialist society”. Our data suggest that higher order needs are dominant in the motivational hierarchy and are significant in determining work outcomes, such as satisfaction, tendency to leave, and stress. We found no evidence for a motivational stereotype characterized by a low level of work involvement, lack of initiative, obedience, etc. hypothesized by other authors. In order to gain a better understanding of work motivation, it is useful to differentiate needs from the opportunities to satisfy those same needs, as well as work motivation from behavioural reaction patterns that actualize the opportunities and relate them to personal outcomes. A specific behavioural reaction pattern seems to exist among Bulgarian workers as an adaptation reaction to the specific environment of the “(post-) Socialist” industrial organization. This pattern, identified as “egocentrism in work”, combines a high involvement in work with partial alienation, i.e. detachment from the organization and income.
