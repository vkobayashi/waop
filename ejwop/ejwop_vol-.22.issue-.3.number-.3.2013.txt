Inspired by Rynes and Barber's and Avery and McKay's theoretical work, we examined factors that influence organizations’ decision to target older applicants and the influence of this decision on other recruiting strategies. Our study of two samples of HR professionals provides mixed support for these theoretical frameworks. Incumbent age and an organizational climate that rewards diversity were related to targeting older workers, whereas an ageist climate and labour market tightness were not. Further, the decision to target older applicants was related to the number of recruitment sources used and, in one sample, an emphasis on work environment benefits. However, this decision was not related to an emphasis on financial stability benefits or to recruiter age.
