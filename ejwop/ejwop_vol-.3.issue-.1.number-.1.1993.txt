A total of 865 bank employees from all grades completed the Spector Work Locus of Control Scale and the adapted Furnham Corporate Assessment Scale, which measure corporate climate on various dimensions. Both questionnaires demonstrated high internal reliability and were closely related. The results suggest that internal locus of control is related to a positive perception of organizational climate, particularly commitment and morale.
