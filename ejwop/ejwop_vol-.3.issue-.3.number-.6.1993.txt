Assessment of probabilistic values which comprise multidimensional attributes (e.g. risk) involves complex cognitive processes. This study explores the degree to which three informational context variables (nature of information, presentational conditions, and context structure), allocated according to a factorial design, affect risk assessment. The risk situation is represented by alarm over a potentially toxic cloud stagnating above a town, and is rated from 1 (negligible) to 10 (lethal) by subjects randomly assigned to one of the eight experimental modalities. Ratings are then processed by analysis of variance. Significant effect is found for the first variable (concrete information gives rise to significantly higher ratings than abstract information) and the second variable (sequential presentation leads to higher ratings), but the third variable would appear to have less functional impact. These results are discussed in the general framework of behavioural theories of decision-making, stressing the relevance of certain concepts and cognitive processes involved in risk assessment.
