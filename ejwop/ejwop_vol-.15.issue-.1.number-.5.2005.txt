The current article argues that taking subjective theories of both the rater and ratee into consideration contributes to a deeper understanding of leadership evaluations. In the present study, individuals' pre-existing implicit personality theory (Dweck, 199616.

It was shown that when judging their managers, raters who believe in the ability to change and the dynamic nature of personality (“incremental theorists”) place significantly stronger weight on the situation and dynamic factors, while raters who believe in the stability of human characteristics (“entity theorists”) focus more strongly on their relationship to these people. Moreover, managers with entity theory are judged significantly more positively than managers with an incremental theory. In view of these findings, implications are derived for the measurement of leadership behaviour as well as information concerning the application of leadership behaviour in an organizational setting.
