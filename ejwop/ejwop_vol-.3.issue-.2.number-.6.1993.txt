This article focuses on a set of new flexible work arrangements commonly referred to as “telework” or “telecommuting”. Although it is not possible to give an unambiguous and precise definition of telework, there is some working consensus on the subject: the belief is held that information technology has made it possible to relocate many types of work involving the electronic processing of information geographically, and telework is the term used to describe workers who have been relocated in this way. An attempt is made to develop a theoretical framework in which telework can be studied. For this purpose the changes that take place in the environment of organizations have been taken into consideration.
