The current study examined interactions between leader – member exchange (LMX) and two dimensions of organizational justice—procedural and interpersonal. Results from a study of full-time employees (n = 283) in a diverse set of job types provide support for the notion that a high quality leader – member relationship (i.e., LMX) enhances the strength of the relationships between procedural and interpersonal justice and a variety of outcomes. Specifically, procedural and interpersonal justice perceptions were significantly associated with an employee's felt obligation to the organization, but only when that employee reported high quality relationships with their supervisors. Results of this study extend research that attempts to integrate the organizational justice and leadership literatures.
