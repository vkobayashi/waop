This study investigated the antecedents and the consequences of employability orientation, i.e., employees' attitudes toward developing their employability for the organization. Supporting the hypotheses, the results showed that employability orientation was positively related to openness, initiative, and the career anchors of managerial competence and variety, and negatively related to tenure, continuance commitment, and the career anchors of technical competence and security. Career anchors mediated the relationship between openness, initiative, and employability orientation; continuance commitment mediated the relationship between tenure and employability orientation. No relationships were found between affective commitment, career development support, and employability orientation; an unexpected negative relationship existed between employability orientation and perceptions of organizational support. Employability orientation proved a strong predictor of employability activities. The implications of this study for employability interventions and for future research are discussed.
