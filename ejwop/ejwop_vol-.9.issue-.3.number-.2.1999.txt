In a cross-sectional field study we found, as predicted, that performance differences between members of semi-autonomous teams were associated with feelings of unfairness. On the basis of equity theory we hypothesized that the relationship between performance differences and unfairness feelings would be moderated for suckers, i.e., team members with relatively high performances, who feel highly rewarded for their efforts, either with high financial rewards, with high task rewards, or with high social rewards. The results showed that financial rewards had no moderating effects, but high social rewards and low task rewards moderated feelings of unfairness for suckers.
