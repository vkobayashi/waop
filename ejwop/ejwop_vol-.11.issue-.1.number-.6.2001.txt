The aim of the study was to investigate gender differences in facing and experiencing workplace bullying. The subjects were 773 male and 123 female prison officers (response rate 64%). In all, 20% of the respondents perceived themselves as victims of bullying. No difference was found in this respect between men and women. Female victims had been subjects of sexual harassment significantly more often than their male colleagues. The persons bullying female officers were usually co-workers, whereas men were bullied by co-workers and supervisors equally often. Unsatisfactory features of work and poor social climate were significant predictors of bullying among both men and women. Bullying had similar effects on the feelings of stress, mental health, and job satisfaction of both men and women.
