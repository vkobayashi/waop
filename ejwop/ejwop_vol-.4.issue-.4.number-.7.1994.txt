This paper deals with the construction of a behavioural questionnaire on sexual harassment. It tries to outline a method for measuring working women's vulnerability to sexual harassment and their degree of adjustment to the pattern profile constructed in this work. This pattern was obtained from scores of 42 different women. Multidimensional Scaling Analysis was used. The results were used to set up an objective profile from which to calculate both the degree of adjustment and the vulnerability of working women to sexual harassment behaviour.
