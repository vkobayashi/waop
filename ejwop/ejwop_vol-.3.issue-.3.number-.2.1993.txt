The attention paid to problems related to mental health of employees in organizations is growing. Although the stress literature is huge and varied, most of the empirical studies are done in traditional work environments in which information technology and computers are of little importance. The recent increasing use of information technology has created a growing number of information processing work environments. The work in those work environments is typically done with data and can be characterized as “mental” work. The general hypothesis in this paper is that people doing mental work relate the perception of their work to mental health. More specifically, this paper describes the relationship between work-related factors and mental health among employees in a typical information processing environment: an insurance company. First, we discuss the concept of mental health. Next, we summarize the results of a number of studies on the determinants of mental health in information work. The results of our study indicate that work and health perception has a greater impact on mental health than work characteristics, personality, and activities outside work. Work perception, health perception, and mental health can be considered as one factor, although there are minor differences between subgroups in the population. In the discussion we try to integrate the findings into a general model of mental health related to work.
