This article explores the question how companies can create a different basis for security for their employees now that job security has increasingly become a thing of the past? An answer to this question is to create a new secure base by developing the employability of workers by sustaining and developing opportunities for work in the future. Promoting employability is part of a new psychological contract between employer and employee, whereby both are responsible for maintaining the employment situation. The employability of employees is determined by their actual know-how and skills; their willingness to be mobile and their knowledge of the labour market. Although the development of employability is not only a matter for labour organizations (branch organizations, the government, and employers' representatives and unions have to do their part too), we focus primarily on the policy that organizations can set out. Policymakers have to answer the following questions: (1) Is it necessary to develop the external or internal employability of employees? (2) For which category is it in particular necessary? (3) If employability does not take place automatically, is this because employees do not want this, or because they cannot do this? Or is it restricted by organizational aspects? Each of these questions will be discussed in this article.
