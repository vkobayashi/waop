Pharmacy workers from a large United Kingdom public hospital participated in a daily diary study (n = 32, number of responses = 204) to explore if daily beliefs about high work demands' influence on affect and goals were associated with daily affective well-being, job satisfaction, and reports of physical symptoms. After completion of an initial questionnaire, participants were required to complete the diary twice daily, before and after work, over a 2 week period. Measures of daily affective well-being and job satisfaction after work were associated with beliefs concerning work demands' influence on both goals and affect. Measures of physical symptoms after work were not associated with beliefs concerning work demands' influence on goals or affect.
