Activities within the Norwegian School Psychology Service traditionally concentrate on assessment of individuals in need and report writing (individual-level treatment). In recent years, a more “systemic” job aspect, providing preschool/school staff with tools to prevent the emergence of problems (systemic-level prevention) has been in demand. This study investigates the predictive value of these distinct aspects of work behaviour in the School Psychology Service using the outcome variables job satisfaction, job involvement, and organizational commitment among employees. It also looks at to what extent such associations may be mediated by positive challenge at work and perceived control at work. Self-reported data were collected from 470 School Psychology counsellors within 121 offices. Structural equation modelling suggested that the preventive aspect of the job was positively related to job attitudes, while the traditional job aspect was not. Furthermore, these associations were partially mediated by positive challenge at work and perceived control at work. Control for age did not alter the magnitude or pattern of regression coefficients in any substantive way. Occupational group did not moderate the associations. Alternative models were tested. Implications are discussed.
