Managerial derailment is costly to managers, their co-workers, and their organization. Knowing whether discrepancies (i.e., differences, dissimilarity, disagreement, incongruity) exist between self- and observer- (subordinates, peers, and bosses) ratings about derailment may help to lessen or prevent the detrimental outcomes of derailment on managers, their co-workers, and their organization. Results from 1742 European managers revealed a statistically significant difference between a manager's self-ratings and observer-ratings on the extent to which a manager displayed derailment behaviours and characteristics. The discrepancy also widened as managerial level increased, and was mostly due to inflated self-ratings. In addition, discrepancies between self – boss, self – direct report, and self – peer were examined, as well as differences between European and American managers. A discussion of these findings and implications for practice conclude this article.
