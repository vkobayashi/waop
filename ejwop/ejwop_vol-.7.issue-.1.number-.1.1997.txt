The term “flexibility” is introduced as the theme of this issue of the journal: its use at the individual, organizational and societal level is discussed. The multiple ways and the different contexts in which it is used make it a problematic term. Yet for employers as well as governments, flexibility in the use and deployment of labour is seen as critical to maintain competitive advantage. However, despite what might be based on good intentions, this drive towards flexibility may leave certain parts of the workforce at least confused and uncertain. There may be other employees who feel part of a “core” group, for whom change is more often positive. Those at the other end of the spectrum are at risk of social exclusion, denied the benefits of full participation in society. Thus flexibility becomes an issue which touches individuals, organizations and governments together, not separately.
