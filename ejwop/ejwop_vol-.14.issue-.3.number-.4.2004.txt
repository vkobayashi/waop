Risk factors and consequences of exposure to violence at work were examined through a systematic review of longitudinal studies of workplace violence. Literature in different databases was screened and the articles were selected on the basis of a set of inclusion criteria. Sixteen studies were included into the review and they were evaluated according to a number of criteria recommended for use in systematic reviews. Of the reviewed studies, 12 met more than half of the evaluation criteria. The studies identified individual, situational, and structural risk factors of workplace violence. Five studies demonstrated that being subjected to violence at work have both acute and long-term consequences for the exposed staff and the workplace. Two studies also found symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in victims. In view of the detrimental effects of violence, it is important that preventive measures are taken and evaluated in future longitudinal studies.
