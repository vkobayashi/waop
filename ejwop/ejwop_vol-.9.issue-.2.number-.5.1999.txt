This article is a discussion of how ideas regarding organizational learning tend to be popularized and presented in a normative way as prescriptions for "the learning organization". These ideas are discussed with respect to their stance in relation to political practices and decision practices in organizations. It is argued that, although the image of the learning organization is attractive to practitioners and seems to be conducive to participative working arrangements, it may be detrimental to participation and dialogue in the long run. It is suggested that some of these problems can be understood and dealt with through the introduction of a relational perspective based upon projects of self-formation and participation.
