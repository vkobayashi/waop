The current study sought to explain a largely overlooked theme in psychological contract literature, that is, how individual factors are related to formation of psychological contract. It investigated the relationship between work centrality, psychological contracts, and job attitudes. It was expected that people with higher work centrality would be less likely to have a transactional contract and more likely to have a relational contract. Furthermore, it was expected that psychological contract mediates the relations between work centrality and job attitudes. Finally, we expected age to moderate the relations between work centrality and the psychological contract, with stronger relations for older workers than for younger workers. Based on life span psychology, it was argued that work centrality becomes an important factor for older workers in deciding whether or not to invest in the relationship with the organization. The study was conducted among 465 employees in a Dutch health care organization. Structural equation models supported the mediating effect of psychological contract types in the relations between work centrality and three job attitudes (work engagement, job satisfaction, and turnover intention). Moreover, it was found that the relations between work centrality and psychological contract were indeed stronger for older workers than for younger workers.
