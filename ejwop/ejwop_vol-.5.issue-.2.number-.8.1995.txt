This article documents two cases describing aspects of an integrated concept on overall and clinical (means of) diagnostics of mobbing victims suffering from psychological/psychosomatic diseases. Mobbing can cause severe illness, occupational and earning disability, social exclusion, and even suicide. It frequently generates chronic syndromes of combined psycho-physical disorders, restricting and impairing the afflicted persons. As a consequence of mobbing, even after a relatively short period of time a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be diagnosed. Later (after about one to two years) a general anxiety disorder (GAD) can evolve. After further chronic progress severe, mainly depressive and/or obsessive syndromes regularly develop. At this stage the personality of the afflicted person is prone to profound and irreversible alteration. We use adapted techniques of anamnesis, especially the differentiated description and analysis of working conditions, supported by a combination of well-documented psycho- and sociometric instruments. The therapy programme for our clinic ranges from six to eight weeks, depending on individual aetiology, characteristics of prevalent syndromes, and therapy response. It is supplementing or replacing ambulant prophylaxis and therapy, as well as the obligatory ambulant aftercare.
