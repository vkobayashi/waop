This study examined workplace bullying through a self-report survey of a sample of 180 adults from diverse occupations and industries in Canada. It was predicted that bullying by others would lead to counteraggressive/bullying behaviours and certain coping responses. In turn, coping with bullying was predicted to impact burnout and well-being. Three different forms of bullying were identified: verbal abuse, work being undermined, and belittlement. The results of the structural relations analyses reveal that both verbal abuse and work being undermined were related to reciprocal forms of bullying. In addition, whereas verbal abuse was related to problem solving as a way of coping with bullying, belittlement was related to self-doubt, indirect/passive coping, and ignoring the bully. Self-doubt was, in turn, related to burnout and symptoms of ill-health.
