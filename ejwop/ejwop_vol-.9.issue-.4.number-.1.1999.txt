In this article, we argue that work and organizational psychology is still dominated by quantitative research studies based on positivist beliefs about the conduct of research. Drawing on Symon and Cassell (1999), we suggest a number of reasons for this continuing situation and outline the ways in which this special issue seeks to overcome some of these <U+0093>barriers to change<U+0094>. We draw attention to the contrasting epistemological beliefs that might inform different research projects and which are illustrated in the articles presented here. The collected articles also demonstrate the insights that using qualitative methods can provide on a wide range of (very practical) organizational issues. We conclude by recommending the consideration of alternative approaches and practices to European w/o psychologists.
