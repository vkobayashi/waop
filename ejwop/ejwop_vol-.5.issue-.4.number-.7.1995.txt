The relationship between life goals and willingness to accept an international assignment is investigated. 109 British managers responded to a questionnaire which tapped their willingness to accept an assignment in various countries and for a variety of different types of organizations. Also they had to indicate the importance of 11 life goals (Exercise Life Goals; Bass, 1976). Two life goals were consistently related to willingness to work abroad, namely: “independence”, which was positively related to willingness to accept an international assignment; and “security”, which was negatively related. Less consistent patterns were found for “self-realization”, “duty”, “pleasure”, and “affection”.
