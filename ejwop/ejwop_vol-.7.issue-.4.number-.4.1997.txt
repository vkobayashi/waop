In the following report, two studies on analysis and training of expert performance in troubleshooting at complex manufacturing plants will be presented. The first and main study deals with a comparison of experts and novices to assess the level of expertise necessary to complete complex diagnostic tasks. Critical behavioural elements and cognitive processes of high performing maintenance technicians were identified by observing maintenance technicians with different levels of expertise while troubleshooting real faults. In addition, training needs were derived from the assessment of inefficient and deficient performance of low performing technicians. The particular training needs emerged in narrowing down the faults and in generating an adequate mental representation of the fault conditions. These findings are discussed with respect to current research in this domain. In the second study, a training programme designed to improve on the exchange of knowledge between experts and novices was evaluated. In this training programme, the acquisition of information search and information processing strategies were taught through elements of the cognitive apprenticeship approach. In addition, mapping techniques were used in group discussions to facilitate the development of knowledge structures that support problem solving in troubleshooting. A first training evaluation shows that diagnostic performance can be improved through this approach.
