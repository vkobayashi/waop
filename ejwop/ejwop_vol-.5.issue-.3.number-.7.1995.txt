The discussion on work flexibility in organizations seems to be promising in terms of self-determination and autonomy of the concerned people.

Therefore the work planning process could be more democratic, since the workers could participate in the decision-making procedure actively. The article investigates how a decision situation can be modelled in order to design a technical support system. In addition it will be analysed as to which social and group dynamic aspects play crucial roles–from a system designer's view. Empirical data on time management processes of various working groups serves as discussion example.
