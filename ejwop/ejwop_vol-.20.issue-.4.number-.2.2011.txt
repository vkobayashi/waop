The study examined the role played by changes in employees' goal-related affects in decreasing burnout during a group intervention. 62 white-collar employees, suffering from severe burnout, were randomized into 10-month group intervention programmes consisting of 16 intensive 1-day sessions every second week. The participants appraised their work and interpersonal goals according to their positive and negative affects weekly for 54 weeks. During the pre- and postintervention and follow-up (6 months later) measurements, the participants filled out a burnout measurement. The results, analysed by multilevel modelling, showed that a decrease in the negative affects and an increase in the positive affects of work and interpersonal goals during the later part of the intervention was related to a decrease in burnout symptoms. The decrease in goal-related negative affects was associated with a decrease in burnout in the postintervention measurement, whereas the increase in goal-related positive affects was related to a decrease in follow-up burnout.
