This article presents a test of the relationship between organizational culture and customer satisfaction using business-unit data from two different companies. The first study examines 32 regional markets of a residential home-building company and the second study examines 148 automobile dealerships. The Denison Organizational Culture Survey (DOCS) is used to measure organizational culture, while customer satisfaction data were collected from customers themselves by independent third parties. With a few exceptions, the culture measures related significantly to customer satisfaction, explaining 28% of the variance for the home-building markets and 11 – 28% of the variance for the auto dealerships.
