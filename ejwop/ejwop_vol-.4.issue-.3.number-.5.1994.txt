System reliability depends on the quality of the coupling between the human and technical components of the system, hence the term “sociotechnical reliability”. The present article is more particularly devoted to the collective dimensions of sociotechnical reliability, and especially the role played by collective activity. Essentially, the aim is to propose a general model of analysis of some of the major features of this role. This model makes explicit the notion of coupling and the regulation loops which accompany the implementation of the activity. The role played by task characteristics (type of task, allocation of tasks within the group, means of co-ordination), group characteristics (composition, collective bias), and coupling characteristics (task versus group structure, contingency model, computer-assisted groups) are examined in turn. Finally, the characteristics of the collective activity itself are discussed: relations to prescribed task, common collective field of reference, communications, self-management of reliability, etc. The model allows collection and organization of knowledge on the themes discussed and, at the same time, supplies a grid for a first analysis of collective activity for the study of reliability.
