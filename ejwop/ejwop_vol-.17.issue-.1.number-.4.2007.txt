The aim of the present study was to analyse the moderator influence of psychological climate on the relationship between leader – member exchange (LMX) quality and role overload. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted in a sample of 383 employees. Results showed that LMX quality was negatively related to role overload and that three out of the four climate dimensions considered moderated the LMX – role overload relationship. This relationship was stronger when innovation climate, goals orientation, and rules orientation were high than when these climate dimensions were low.
