In a study of male and female members of the German work-force, interview-based measures of personal initiative were examined as a function of age in combination with demographic and work characteristics. No significant age differences were found for male employees' initiative in job behaviour, but a negative age-pattern was found for men's and women's initiative in educational activities. When measured by questionnaire self-reports and by spouse/partners' descriptions, initiative tended to be greater at older ages.
