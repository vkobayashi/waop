The present article tests whether two theoretically relevant individual differences moderate the impact of perceived fairness on organizational attachment among young professionals in a large Dutch multinational firm. Drawing on the relational and control perspectives on organizational justice, we predict that any relationship between perceived fairness and organizational attachment will differ between individuals with varying beliefs in personal control and will be stronger for individuals with high interdependent self-construal (ISC). The findings revealed that almost all positive main effects of perceived fairness on organizational attachment were indeed moderated by either type of personality. As a result, we found support for both the relational as well as the control perspective, depending on the type of attachment considered. “Hard” reciprocation through extrarole behaviour seems to be inspired by the empowering impact of control through fairness. “Soft” reciprocation by affection and staying intentions (cognitions) on the other hand, results from the relational bond that is strengthened by fair treatment.
