Although input–process–output models of teamwork are quite popular, relatively few studies have tested empirically the mediation of team design and team context variables on team effectiveness by team process variables. This review briefly describes mediation effects of team process variables. Moreover, moderating effects of different team tasks and types of teamwork are summarized. Based on this framework, we introduce and compare the four articles included in this special issue which provide examples of process-oriented studies in different types of teamwork. In doing so, these studies not only illustrate the variety of potential team process variables (e.g., communication between team members, team reflexivity and self-regulation, self-leadership of team members) but also different methodological strategies to explore them.
