The current research examined a moderated mediation model for the relationships among indicators of objective career success (salary and job level), subjective career success (career satisfaction), and turnover intention, as well as the boundary conditions of this process. Based on a survey study among a sample of Chinese managers (N = 324), we found that both salary and job level were negatively related to turnover intention, with these relations fully mediated by career satisfaction. The results further showed that the relation between job level and career satisfaction was weaker among managers who perceived a higher level of organizational career management, but stronger among managers with a higher managerial career anchor. In support of our hypothesized model, the indirect effect of job level on turnover intention through career satisfaction existed only among managers who perceived a lower level of organizational career management or managers with a higher managerial career anchor. These findings carry implications for research on career success and turnover intention.
