The aim of this article is to describe an equal opportunities audit aimed at developing the career potential and opportunities of employees in a UK national bank. The major aims of the equal opportunities audit were: (1) to identify the position of employees in the bank by gender, race, disability, and age; (2) to identify the reasons (e.g. policy/structural barriers) and/or attitu-dinal barriers for job segregation and barriers to recruitment, training, and career progression (particularly into higher managerial grades); (3) to make appropriate recommendations for change to ensure equality of opportunity for all bank employees. A two-phased approach to data collection was utilized in this audit, namely the use of qualitative information in the form of in-house data/materials and group interview sessions, and quantitative data (statistically analysed) from the distribution of a large-scale sample (piloted), postal questionnaire (JV = 595, a 30.5% rate of response). The results were analysed in terms of issues associated with recruitment, promotion, training, working conditions, and the development of career opportunities. Differences were examined between personnel employed in seven UK locations and working within one of four job-grade bands. Gender, disability, and ethnicity differences in the responses were also investigated. The findings indicated that barriers to equality of opportunity and career development in the bank are likely to be localized to specific locations and impacting on those in certain grades. For these reasons, adoption of a blanket policy might not meet the needs of personnel seeking to maximize their career potential and opportunities in the bank.
