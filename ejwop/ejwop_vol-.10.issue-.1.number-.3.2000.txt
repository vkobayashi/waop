In this article, causal relations among three dimensions of burnout, as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory, were examined. Three causal models were examined using data from five earlier published longitudinal studies. Models were fitted using structural equation modelling (SEM) with multi-group analysis. In the best fitting model, personal accomplishment synchronously influenced depersonalization and depersonalization on its turn synchronously influenced emotional exhaustion. Practical implications of this model for the prevention of burnout were suggested.
