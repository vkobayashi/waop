The aim of the study was to examine perceived job insecurity and its antecedents and outcomes over a three-year time period. Job insecurity was operationalized by four scales based on the global and multidimensional definition of job insecurity. The study was carried out by means of questionnaires, which were administered three times, in 1995 (Time 1), 1996 (Time 2), and 1997 (Time 3), to employees in three organizations: a paper mill, a bank, and a municipal social and health care department. The present article is based on the data of those employees (N = 109) who participated in each year of the study. The results indicated that global worry about one's job continuity (global scale) and the probability of negative changes in one's job (probability scale) shared similar elements most and both of them were predicted by low self-esteem over the three-year period. Only the evaluations of the probability of negative job changes led to negative outcomes in occupational well-being later on.
