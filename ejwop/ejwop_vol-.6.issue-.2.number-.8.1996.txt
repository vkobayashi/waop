In participatory policy-making processes many different stakeholders have access to the policy-making arena. In order to benefit from the diversity of perspectives the stakeholders carry with them, interaction between these stakeholders should be facilitated. Three modes of facilitation are distinguished which differ in the balance they seek between divergence and convergence: inducement of better understanding, shared perspective, and policy learning. In particular it is examined how the technique of gaming simulation facilitates participatory policy making. From the application of this technique it is derived that a minimum common ground is necessary as a starting point for participatory policy making. Participatory policy making should start with a common challenge as well as agreement between stakeholders on some core concepts and rules of interaction. At any moment, stakeholders should be forced to put the common ground that is evolving up for discussion.
