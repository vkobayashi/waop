This Action Research study came out of a mutual cooperation between the psychosomatic and psychotherapy departments of a large clinic in Germany. The perceptions of a number of members of a team of caretakers within an Oncology Ward were investigated using a Repertory Grid. The paper comments on the similarities and differences bewteen the various team members. In particular, it focuses on the Repertory Grids from the patient and the physician. Recognizing that teams are the building blocks of organizations, the paper suggests that Repertory Grid technology, when implemented as an heuristic device, can provide the basis for team members to consider their various roles and negotiate their aims and objectives.
