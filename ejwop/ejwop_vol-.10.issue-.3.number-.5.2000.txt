The objective of this study was to make a contribution to the question how team learning can be studied. A model of the constituting activities of the team learning process was articulated, and it was explored whether the learning activities relate to learning outcomes. The sample consists of 29 teams of business students who were assigned to fulfill an assignment for a company. We asked them to fill out a questionnaire at the start and at the end of this project. The teams' performance was rated. The relationships between the learning activities reported, the diversity in attitude towards the task, the amount of team learning, and the team's performance were explored. The propositions were partly supported by the data. Central conclusions are that a higher diversity in attitude towards the task is related to a higher experienced amount of learning and that in projects of short duration it is especially storing and retrieving that leads to higher team performance.
