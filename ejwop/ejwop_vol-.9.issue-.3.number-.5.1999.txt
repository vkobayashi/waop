This article reports the findings of a study of graduates' expectations and experiences of organizational and individual career management practices and of the relationships between organizational career management, career selfmanagement, and organizational commitment. It finds that, despite the prevailing rhetoric that individuals must take responsibility for their own careers, organizations are still heavily involved in the career management of their graduate recruits. Furthermore, organizational career management makes a positive contribution to graduates' organizational commitment, whereas most forms of career self-management do little to discourage it. However, graduates appear to benefit from different kinds of career management at different stages in their first 10 years in the organization.
