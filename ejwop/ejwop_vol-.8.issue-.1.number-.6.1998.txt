The action research study focuses on the ways a successful general manager engages in a process of large organizational change of a business unit. The unit itself had undergone an overhaul earlier as part of a corporate-wide organizational change project to decentralize power to its business units. The study is limited to that particular phase in which three levels of management take part in a search conference in order to develop a broad basis of involvement. The major observations and psychodynamic processes are subsequently discussed in relation to an older study of successful general managers and to the changed relations between leaders and followers after intensive restructuring.
