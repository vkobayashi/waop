The emphasis of this theoretical note focuses on the link between the concepts of uncertainty and resourcefulness in performance contexts such as professional sport and manufacturing industry. Integrative themes from sport, work, and organization psychology are highlighted. Rigid work organization based on job demarcation and inflexible role specification reduces personal control and instils perfunctory attention to work procedures. In contrast, the sociotechnical systems approach provides a framework for examining how localized control of variance in performance output may be developed through the recognition and promotion of tacit knowledge in individuals. Additionally, through consideration of the theory of learned resourcefulness, the self-regulation of goal-directed activities and a repertoire of cognitive-behavioural skills are suggested as important factors influencing productivity and health at the organizational and individual level. Throughout, the interconnection between these diverse theoretical perspectives is discussed.
