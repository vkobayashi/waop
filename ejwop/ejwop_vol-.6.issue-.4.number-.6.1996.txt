This article suggests that envy is entwined with leadership in a number of complex and potentially problematic ways. It examines how aspects such as skill, power, authority, and prestige that are associated with leadership may evoke the envy of subordinates and colleagues. Envy may also be stirred up in the leader s family, friends, and colleagues outside the organization. Equally, leaders themselves may be prone to feeling envious of subordinates, colleagues, and others who they feel may threaten their position. Based on research using psychoanalytic concepts, it is suggested that because envy is so painful to bear it is often consigned to the unconscious, so that those who are envious are unaware or only partly aware of the extent and nature of their feelings. This can result in the subtle, indirect and often insidious expression of envy which undermines leadership and interferes with the effective running of the organization.
