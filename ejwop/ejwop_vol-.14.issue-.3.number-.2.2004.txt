The present study examined the relation of demands and social support, and positive and negative Work-Home (WHI) and Home-Work interference (HWI) with the subjective well-being of expatriates. Moreover, we were also interested in crossover effects of expatriate interference to the subjective well-being of their spouses. In a questionnaire study among expatriate couples (N<U+200A>=<U+200A>72), we found that particularly home demands, and the negative spillover effects of expatriate roles at home on their work roles were related to expatriate and spouse subjective well-being. Crossover effects from one partner to the other seemed to run via subjective well-being in one partner to subjective well-being in the other, supporting the idea of emotional contagion among couples in times of stress.
