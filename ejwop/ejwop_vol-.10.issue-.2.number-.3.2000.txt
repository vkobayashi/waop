Several issues concerning the use of self-report lateness data as an alternative to records based information were examined here, including potential underreporting and construct validity through convergent-discriminant validity. Information on records-based lateness behaviour of 155 white-collar workers was compared to responses on a questionnaire that included an attitudinal scale and a self-report measure of lateness behaviour. Results indicated that self-reports of lateness are moderately correlated with the information available from the subjects' files; the mean for the former was lower than the latter; and organizational commitment is more highly correlated with a self-report measure than with actual behaviour. Several possible explanations for these findings were offered and situations where the continued use of self-report data was justified were described.
