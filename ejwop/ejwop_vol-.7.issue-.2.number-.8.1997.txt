This article examines a case of change management in the Italian public sector. Employees designed and realized innovation in work processes and improved service quality. Over time, however, they preferred to fall back on the work organization, roles, and service levels that had existed prior to change. The same employees who pioneered organizational change and better service destroyed everything that they themselves had designed. In this article, the author explores why the employees changed their minds. The participation process assured the initial success of the change process. However, in order to make sure that change processes do not reverse, employee participation needs to be supported with tools for building more effective relationships with peers. This way, employees can develop symmetrical relationships as a source of individual recognition.
