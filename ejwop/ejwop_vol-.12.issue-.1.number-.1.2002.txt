A six-country meta-analysis of the validity of tests of general mental ability (GMA) and cognitive ability for employee selection was carried out. Across each country (France, Germany, the Low Countries [Belgium plus The Netherlands], Spain, and the UK) two criterion measures are considered-job performance and training success. Comprehensive literature searches resulted in 128 primary studies against job performance (total N=12,128) and 122 studies for training success (total N=22,987), all of which are included in this meta-analysis. Results indicate strong support for the validity of GMA measures in personnel selection against both criteria. In this study, operational validities ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 were found for the EC countries included and these operational validities generalized across occupations within each country. Implications for personnel selection in the EC, future research of both primary validity studies and metaanalyses, and the use of GMA measures and tests of cognitive ability are discussed.
