Emotion work (emotional labour) is defined as emotional regulation required to display organizationally desired emotions by the employees. It has received increased attention because it is relevant in the service industry where social interactions with customers, clients, or patients are a significant part of the job. Empirical studies found equivocal effects on psychological well-being which indicates that emotion work is a multidimensional construct with dimensions having positive and negative health effects. In the present studies, the following aspects of emotion work were differentiated: emotional regulation requirements: (1) the requirement to display positive emotions; (2) the requirement to display negative emotions, (3) the requirement to be sensitive to clients' emotions; (4) emotional dissonance: the expression of emotions that are not felt. Analyses were based on a representative sample (N = 184) of service workers and another sample of service workers (N = 1158) consisting of call centre agents, hotel and bank employees, and kindergarten teachers. The data showed that emotional dissonance was the stressful aspect of emotion work, whereas the display of positive emotions and sensitivity requirements also had positive effects on personal accomplishment. The requirement to express negative emotions had little effect on burnout. Neuroticism had little impact on the relations between emotion work and burnout.
