This study investigated the meaning of working for subjects from three levels of an organizational hierarchy. Staff members of a high technology manufacturing organization were surveyed using an abridged version of the Meaning of Working Questionnaire. Five central aspects of the ‘meaning of working’ concept were explored using this instrument, namely Work Centrality, Work Role Identification, Valued Working Outcomes, Societal Norms about Working, and Work Goals. Results show a high level of shared perceptions by members of the three hierarchical levels on ‘meaning of working’ variables, a finding which is at odds with past research, which for the most part indicates clear hierarchal effects. Such findings are discussed within the context of the internal processes of the organization as well as in a specific industry-wide framework.
