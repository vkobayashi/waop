There are good reasons for encouraging creativity in organizations, teams, project groups, and networks: firstly, creativity is one of the main prerequisites for innovation; secondly, the breaking down of hierarchies reinforces imaginativeness, dynamism, and autonomy at all levels of the company; and thirdly, the creativity of the employees is one of the few domains, after all the rationalization and restructuring has been done, in which there is still considerable development potential to be found. In this way creativity becomes one of the basic qualifications for all employees. So it is only logical that companies should want to stimulate and support the creative potential of their staff, work groups, and teams. Unfortunately, it isn't all that easy to free up creative energy: new ideas and innovative vigour don't just materialize of their own free will–they require a special background and specific conditions for growth while also demanding nurturing and stimulation. “Creativity workshops” are one tool to promote innovation in organizations.
