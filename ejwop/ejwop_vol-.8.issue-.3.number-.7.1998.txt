In this article, Vansina's assertions expressed in his comments on my article: "Fantasies and fairy tales in groups and organizations: Bion's basic assumptions and the deep roles" (Moxnes, 1998) are refuted. Bion's possible hatred for his parents, his tendency for schizoid isolation, his abandonment of group studies, and his detached leadership style are discussed. The relationship between basic assumptions and deep roles are clarified, and some new ideas about the unconscious in groups and organizations are suggested. It is maintained that access to the unconscious is an age-old function of everyday life and that introspection of the collective unconscious is possible. A fourth basic assumption related to deep roles is proposed, and support for the existence of deep roles in psychodynamic group research is given.
