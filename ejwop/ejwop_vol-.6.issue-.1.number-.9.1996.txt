This article examines how the analysis of spoken attributions can be used to explore organizational sensemaking. A case study is presented to illustrate differences and similarities in the attributions produced by engineers taking part in a culture change programme within a multinational manufacturing organization. Semi-structured interviews with six UK and five German engineers elicited 419 attributions which were coded using a modified version of the Leeds Attributional Coding System. Findings indicate that, in comparison with German engineers, UK engineers produced more global attributions for the change programme and perceived it as having a company-wide influence upon employee behaviour. In addition, although UK engineers produced more attributions describing the company as causing negative outcomes, similar attributions from German engineers were more stable, suggesting that the company was perceived as having a more permanent influence. The potential uses and limitations of this approach within a cross-cultural context are discussed.
