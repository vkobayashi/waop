Theoretical and empirical developments with the locus of control construct demonstrate that it is a context-specific multidimensional construct that has implications for stress and well-being. In this paper, the multidimensionality of work-specific locus of control is explored by subjecting Spector's work locus of control scale to principal components analysis. Using samples of 221 university staff and 399 accountants, a two-dimensional structure was uncovered; external agents control and personal control. Correlations with constructs that have been theoretically and empirically associated with locus of control indicate slightly divergent results for the two dimensions, thus demonstrating the importance of treating locus of control as a domain-specific multidimensional construct. In addition, test-retest data with a subsample of 246 accountants suggested that work locus of control may be thought of as a state rather than trait measure.
