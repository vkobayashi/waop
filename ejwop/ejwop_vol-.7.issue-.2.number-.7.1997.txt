Most of political analyses on organizational change have been focused, until now, on “bounded” systems, within which the different stakeholders and their strategies may be identified more or less clearly. We here envisage to what extent a political view on organizational change is still appropriate to a context characterized by the emergence of “unbounded” systems, built on the use of network technologies and combining different kind of work co-ordination/liaison mechanisms with diverse categories (hybridization process). Starting from the examination of a particular case of an “unbounded” organization (a call centre), this article tends to explore the weight of power games during a process of change. Two categories of variables seem to play a critical role: (1) the kind of liaison mechanisms established between “external partners” (clients, providers, etc.) and the local unit considered; (2) the kind of partnership negotiated between them. We thus obtain a flexible model of change, mobilizing simultaneously contingent and political approaches. This model proposes different principles of organizational change in and around “unbounded” systems: some of them leading to a relative failure, others to the renewal of current structural arrangements.
