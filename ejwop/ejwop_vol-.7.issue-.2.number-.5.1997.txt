The use of nine influence tactics by four groups in organizations in constructive change processes was investigated in a field study with 479 participants. Data were collected with a Dutch version of Yukl's Influence Behaviour Questionnaire. The frequency with which line managers, staff specialists, consultants, and works council, delegates used the various influence tactics was examined. Furthermore, differences in direction of influence (upward, downward, or lateral) were assessed and compared to results of previous research in different settings. It was found that rational persuasion, inspirational appeals, and consultation were the most frequently used influence tactics. This is an encouraging finding because these three tactics are most effective for gaining target commitment to a proposal or request. In addition, it was found that the four groups used several influence tactics differently. Finally, only three directional differences in tactic use matched prior findings. This result suggests that constructive change processes lead employees to display different influence behaviour than they would in less uncertain and ambiguous circumstances.
