Explanations are sought for the small proportion of female managers in Northern Ireland. A series of hypotheses about the job involvement of certain men and women and about the attitudes of men and women towards women as managers are tested. Results based on a survey of 99 women and 79 men indicate that there are no differences in the job involvement of men and women at the same job level, and that men are less predisposed to accept women as managers than are women. These results offer some explanation for the small number of female managers in the Province.
