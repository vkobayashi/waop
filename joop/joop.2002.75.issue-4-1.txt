To examine factors influencing readiness for healthcare organizational change, 654 randomly selected hospital staff completed questionnaires measuring the logistical and occupational risks of change, ability to cope with change and to solve jobrelated problems, social support, measures of Karasek's (1979) active vs. passive job construct (job demand√ó decision latitude) and readiness for organizational change. Workers in active jobs (Karasek, 1979) which afforded higher decision latitude and control over challenging tasks reported a higher readiness for organizational change scores. Workers with an active approach to job problem-solving with higher job change self-efficacy scores reported a higher readiness for change. In hierarchical regression analyses, active jobs, an active job problem-solving style and job-change self-efficacy contributed independently to the prediction of readiness for organizational change. Time 1 readiness for organizational change scores and an active approach to job problem-solving were the best predictors of participation in redesign activities during a year-long re-engineering programme.
