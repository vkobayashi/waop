To the layman at least, the differentialist tradition of vocational guidance has the advantage of using objective tools such as tests, norms and profiles which act as a defence against the charge of subjective bias. Because the developmentalist aims to ‘understand’ the growth and development of an individual's vocational maturity, these traditional tools are of limited value. Repertory grids are a relatively new tool which seem to offer a solution to the developmentalist's problem: it is an ideographic method which aims, literally, to map objectively an individual's own ideas about the world of work and the different occupational routes. The aim of this paper is to present a case study which outlines the basic repertory grid method and highlights some of its many possibilities.
