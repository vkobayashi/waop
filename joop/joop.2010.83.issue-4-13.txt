The purpose of this study was to investigate if shared perceptions of organizational justice affect externally rated group-level performance. Previous studies did not consider distributive justice, nor did they control for the possible confounding effects of baseline performance. The present study relates shared perceptions of procedural, interactional, and distributive justice to externally rated departmental level academic performance and takes previous performance into account. We found support for the distributive justiceâ€“performance link, partial support for the procedural justice-performance link, but contrary to our expectations interactional justice was unrelated to performance. All in all, the results seem to support the call for a re-examination of the role of distributive justice in organizational processes.
