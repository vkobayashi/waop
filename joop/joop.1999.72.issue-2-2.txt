Questionnaire data from 213 members of a voluntary professional organization were used to examine the interactive effects of outcome favourability and structural procedural fairness in organizational decision making on members' commitment to and resentment towards the organization. The focal interaction emerged on resentment such that members had particularly high resentment when the outcome was unfavourable and procedures were unfair. However, contrary to prior results from field studies relating to employer organizations, the interaction did not emerge on commitment. This latter finding may be attributable to the nature of the material outcomes established by voluntary professional organizations and an emphasis by members on psychological outcomes such as selfesteem.
