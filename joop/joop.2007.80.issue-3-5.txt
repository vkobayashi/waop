In this study, we examine the relationships between newcomers' competence in specific work activity clusters and the evaluation of their performance. Longitudinal data were gathered on 92 novice nurses from themselves and from the senior staff at three stages: before entering the job, 6 weeks after entry and 18 months after entry. Results showed that, after entry, a newcomer's competence in the cluster of care activities contributed more to a positive performance evaluation than competence in the cluster of non-care activities. Competence in the non-care cluster was only found to contribute to a positive performance evaluation, if the newcomer also showed competence in the care cluster. Moreover, novices showed a greater improvement in their care competence than their non-care competence during the first 18 months of socialization. Finally, we found that after 18 months competence in the non-care cluster contributes more to a positive performance evaluation than competence in the care cluster.
