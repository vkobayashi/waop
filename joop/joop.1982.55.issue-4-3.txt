This study focuses on the evaluation of a traditional selection system for identifying the officer potential of women applicants for commissioned service in the Israeli military. Four hundred applicants were assessed utilizing well-designed traditional instruments. The performance on each of these instruments was validated against the final score attained by the applicants in officer training.
The best predictor was found to be the peer nomination score. It was also found that a differentially weighted composite of the predictors was superior to an equal weighted composite. The implications of these findings are discussed with regard to the use of a well-designed traditional selection system as an alternative to the assessment centre procedure for identifying officer potential.
