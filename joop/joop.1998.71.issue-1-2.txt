The interactive effect of role conflict and role ambiguity on job performance was examined in a sample from an Israeli industrial organization. The results supported the hypothesis that simultaneous increases in both role conflict and role ambiguity are associated with lower levels of job performance. Implications of the results and suggestions for future studies are discussed.
