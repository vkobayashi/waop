The main aim of this paper is to extend the suitability of the concepts of the boundaryless and the protean career for the study of career mobility. To do so, we introduce a conceptual model that maps out the main factors determining and constraining transitions in careers. This model shows marks of European thinking on careers. It not only builds on aspects of both the boundaryless and protean career concepts, but also extends the focus by paying attention to the interplay between agency and structure. It adds to our understanding of the complex interplay between individual and structural factors shaping individuals' careers. An additional added value of the model is that it is built on insights from diverse research streams, including self-determination theory and turnover literature. The article concludes with a discussion of the main contributions of the model and directions for future research.
