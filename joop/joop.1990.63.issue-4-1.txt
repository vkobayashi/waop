A field study in three organizations investigated gender differences in subordinates' perceptions of managers' power. For 55 female and 55 male managers matched on position power, one subordinate per manager (N = 110, half male and half female) completed a questionnaire. Perceived reward, legitimate, expert and referent power were all intercorrelated, but unrelated to coercive power. Male and female managers did not show the expected differences in combined, reward, coercive, legitimate and referent power. Contrary to predictions, subordinates rated female managers higher than male managers on expert power. Male managers with female subordinates were rated lower on combined and expert power than other gender combinations. Implications are discussed.
