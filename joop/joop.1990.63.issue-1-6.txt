Self-ratings and supervisor ratings were obtained for 40 unit managers. Self-ratings were predicted by length of service, whereas supervisor ratings were also predicted by previous appraisal ratings, performance, and career progression. Both self-ratings and supervisor ratings predicted subsequent performance in the form of unit admissions and gross profit. The predictive power of self-ratings was explained in terms of the interactive theory of self-efficacy.
