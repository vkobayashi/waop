A computer-administered test of visual attention was investigated as a predictor of driving accident involvement. Three forms of the test were administered to three independent samples. The correlation between test performance and self-reported driving accident involvement was significant. Furthermore, the magnitude of this relationship was within the upper range of validities typically reported for most selection devices. The potential utility of the test and suggestions for future research are discussed.
