Process tracing has become popular as a means of analysing a person's cognitive activities during complex work tasks. These tasks may be real or simulated. Despite the popularity of process tracing, no single methodology or prescribed set of techniques has emerged from the literature. There is variation in both the goal of process tracing and how it is carried out although unfortunately its nature and accompanying justification are often not made explicit. This paper proposes a four-stage generic model of process tracing comprising: data collection (including behavioural records, verbal reports and eye movements); transcription, integration and segmentation of data into a time-lined account; coding using cognitive categories; and further analysis and representation of the data. How these stages are accomplished is discussed in the context of examples from a range of field studies together with principles of good practice.
