Based on findings from the domain of organizational frustration, the conceptual similarity between stress and frustration, and the functional similarity between frustrated events and work stressors, the relationships of behaviours (aggression, withdrawal, theft and substance use) with work stressors and affective reactions were investigated. Relations between reported stressors and behaviours were strongest for the more directly aggressive actions (sabotage, interpersonal aggression, and hostility and complaints), and for intention to quit. Relations with theft and absence were modest. None of the stressors correlated with reported substance use at work. Among the relations between affective reactions and the reported behaviours, anger and job satisfaction correlated with all behaviours except substance use at work. Hierarchical regression results further showed that the observed associations between stressors and behaviours were not attributed to affective variables for most cases.
