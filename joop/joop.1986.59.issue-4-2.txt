There is an important need for a wider public recognition of psychological approaches to the design and introduction of the new work systems based on microelectronics. The economic and political climate in the UK has not been very supportive of social science orientations, however, and approaches which have been influenced by psychological theory have been limited in their effects. Contributions made by ergonomics, socio-technical theory and participative systems design are considered, and criticisms that have been made of each are reviewed. In an analysis of how psychological and social science approaches differ from conventional views on how best to manage the introduction of the technologies two alternative models, the ‘task and technology approach’ and the ‘organization and end-user approach’, are presented. Stages in the cycle of innovation associated with the introduction of the technologies are identified and alternative assumptions that may guide practices within them are outlined. The need for a wider appreciation of the advantages of the ‘organization and end-user approach’ is discussed. It is suggested that psychologists should emphasize the indeter-minism of the technologies, develop techniques to assist people to exploit this in particular situations, and cultivate an ‘inclusive’ orientation to the presentation of their work.
