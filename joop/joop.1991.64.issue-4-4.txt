This study investigated workplace variables and affective responses as precursors of intentions to leave organizations via a survey of 306 women managers. The contribution of workplace variables typically included in turnover studies was assessed, as well as that of additional variables thought to be particularly pertinent to professional women's organizational experiences. The results of a canonical correlation analysis indicated that women who felt that their expectations had not been met, who described their jobs as limited in leadership, responsibility, variety, time flexibility and autonomy and who cited office politics and being in a male dominated environment as potential factors in a leave decision, expressed low job satisfaction and organizational commitment and had a greater intention to leave. Implications for organizations are discussed and directions for further research are suggested.
