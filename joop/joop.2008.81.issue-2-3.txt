Using data from two large multinational samples, this research sought to contribute to our knowledge of international organizational behaviour by examining the cross-national generalizability of organizational commitment. Sample 1 included employees of 10 subsidiaries of a large multinational organization, whereas Sample 2 relied on data collected in 25 nations in the context of a large opinion survey. Results in both samples supported the expectation that measures of commitment would be more susceptible to measurement non-equivalence than measures of job satisfaction. Differences in relationships between commitment and satisfaction across countries were observed in both samples, as were differences in mean commitment levels. Nation-level individualism/collectivism (I/C) failed to account for the observed differences, however, suggesting that commitment and I/C are largely independent, despite theoretical arguments to the contrary. Results of the study suggest that despite some cross-national variation, differences in commitment across national boundaries are small and empirically unrelated to I/C.
