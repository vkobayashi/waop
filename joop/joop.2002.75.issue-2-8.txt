The purpose of this note is to critique methodological aspects of G. Blau's (2001) test of the discriminant validity of the Carson, Carson, and Bedeian (1995) measure of career enhancement. Blau concluded that career entrenchment may be better represented as a two- rather than three-dimensional construct. An anaysis of Blau's measurement procedures and data, however, questions this conclusion.
