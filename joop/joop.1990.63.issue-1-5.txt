The influence of candidate non-verbal behaviour (NVB) upon interviewer impression formation in the graduate selection interview was investigated using a modified Brunswik lens model approach. The impact of three dysfunctions in interviewer decision making found to be salient in previous research was also examined: similar-to-me effect, personal liking bias and prototype bias. Thirty-eight graduate interviewers participated in the study and completed assessments on 330 interviewees for 14 diverse occupational groups. Interviewer outcome decisions were found to be substantially linearly dependent upon impressions of candidate personality which were in turn linearly dependent upon candidate facial area NVBs. Overall evaluations correlated r = .50 with ratings of similarity-to-self and r = .64 with ratings of personal liking, indicating the pervasive bias of these two factors. Virtually no significant differences were found in accepted candidate personality profiles across the 14 job functions, suggesting the marked impact of prototype bias upon interviewer decision making. Implications for graduate recruitment practices, particularly usage of the selection interview, are discussed.
