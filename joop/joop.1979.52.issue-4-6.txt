Of all the techniques used in personnel selection, reference reports are the most under-researched. This paper reviews the current research on reference reports from four perspectives: (1) their frequency of use in business and industry; (2) their desired and empirical content; (3) their evaluation as selection instruments via traditional psychometric criteria (i.e. reliability and validity); and (4) legal considerations and constraints associated with their use. While the existing literature on reference reports indicates that they are frequently used as a selection device, their psychometric properties do not warrant the extensive use they receive. Reference reports are characterized by low inter-rater reliability and low criterion-related validity. Problems of leniency and restriction in range in reference reports are discussed. The impact of recent legislation influencing the use of reference reports in personnel selection is reviewed. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the utility of reference reports as a selection device in personnel management.
