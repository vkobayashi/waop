Numerous instruments have been developed to assess coping strategies used by individuals during stressful transactions. We discuss some of the problems and limitations inherent in existing coping measures, along with issues surrounding their development. An alternative approach to examining stress coping is proposed, based upon critical incident analysis of stressors experienced by individuals, the behaviours they exhibit and the outcomes of those behaviours. While some studies have used aspects of this technique, the present proposal offers a framework for assessing the interrelationships between stressors, behaviours and consequences.
