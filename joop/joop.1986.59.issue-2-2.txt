The accuracy and reliability of SDy estimates (the standard deviation of job performance in Dollars) derived using the method introduced by Schmidt et al. (1979) was investigated using estimates for the position of medical insurance claim approver. As a test of accuracy, the resulting estimates of SDy and Dollar values of performance at the 15th, 50th, and 85th percentiles were compared to more objective values of these parameters based on job information. Although the estimates of SDy were significantly lower than the actual SDy value, the estimates of the Dollar value of performance at all three percentiles were not significantly different from the actual values. The inter-rater reliability of the Schmidt el al. method was investigated within the context of generalizability theory and was found to be relatively low (p^2=0·56), as was the stability of SDy estimates over a six-month period (r=0·38).
