Using three samples of applicant data, encompassing over 2300 participants, the Concept Model 5.2 Occupational Personality Questionnaire (OPQ) was examined for scale discriminability at the item, scale and factorial level. Item analysis and maximum likelihood factor analysis indicated that the OPQ questionnaire provided good, low complexity measurement on 22 out of the 31 scales. Nine exhibited poor signal-to-noise ratios, high item complexity indices, and insufficient number of keyed loadings on the appropriate factor. On the basis of the results below and from those reported by Matthews & Stanton (1994), it was argued that the test requires further development in conjunction with the revision of the psychological and measurement models specified as underlying its construction.
