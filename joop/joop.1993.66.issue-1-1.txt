The study examined the combined effect of superiors' (N = 257) sex-role identity, superiors' sex and subordinates' sex on personnel ratings. The subjects' sex-role identities were measured by the Bern Sex-Role Inventory. The subjects also assessed subordinates with a performance assessment scale for an actual selection process. As expected, the sex-typed subjects rated the opposite-sex subordinates more favourably than the same-sex subordinates, whereas non-sex-typed subjects rated same-sex and opposite-sex subordinates equally. The results are discussed in terms of raters' sex-role identity and with consideration for further research on sex-effects in personnel ratings.
