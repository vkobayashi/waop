Seven months after school-leaving 647 young people were interviewed. Path analysis was used to examine the predictors of unemployment and psychological well-being. It was found that young people were at risk of being unemployed if they had an unemployed father, few or no qualifications, low work motivation, and if they were West Indian. Young people who were unemployed, from social class 4 and 5, or female, had poor mental health as measured by the General Health Questionnaire. Work involvement moderated the relationship between employment status and mental health.
