The current study investigated the impact of job stressors on well-being from the perspective of person-environment fit. Based upon a 288-case sample from six organizations, we found that the actual and preferred career advancement themselves and their second-order (curvilinear) combinations jointly predicted job satisfaction, mental well-being, and turnover intention. Also, the actual and preferred quality of relationships at work and their second-order (curvilinear) combinations jointly predicted job satisfaction, mental and physical well-being, and turnover intention. Some possible mechanisms underlying the stressor-outcome relationship and their implications are discussed.
