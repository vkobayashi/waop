Eighty-eight clerical employees completed a checklist measuring ‘fatigue’ at hourly intervals over each day of the work-week. The consistency between the results of this and other studies suggests that the progress of fatigue in eight-hour work situations has a general form, although large individual differences occur over both the work-day and work-week. Individual variation seems to be the result of motivational and attitudinal factors, at least in part. Similarity of effects for four- and five-day-week employees suggests cyclic patterns involving learning emerge in clerical work settings. Measures of fatigue were also related to employee job satisfaction and employer satisfaction with performance, as well as 15 other variables referring to individual characteristics or conditions of employment.
