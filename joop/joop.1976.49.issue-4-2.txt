Persistent job changers amongst early school leavers in the National Survey have been followed up in three studies. In the first, young people particularly at risk of not settling at work are identified from information available to school teachers and careers officers. In the second, the effects of job changing on job satisfaction, use of abilities, pay and unemployment are assessed, and persistent job changers found to be at no real disadvantage. Finally, the relationships between job changing and social and psychiatric problems are explored, with frequent job changing in the early years being shown to be an indicator of later personal problems. These findings, and their implications, are discussed in the context of alternative hypotheses for the relationship between job changing and later problems. It is concluded that although persistent job changing in the early years at work may indicate problems of personal adjustment, there is no evidence that it leads, by the mid-twenties, to occupational problems or 10 a secondary, low paid, labour market.
