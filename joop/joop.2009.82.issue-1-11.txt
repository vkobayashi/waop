Through two studies with diverse samples, we tested a conceptual model of the relationships between organizational and career factors and older workers' intention to remain with their organization. Perceived organizational support mediated the relationship between training and development practices, hierarchical, and job content plateauing and intention to remain. Career satisfaction mediated the relationship between perceived organizational support, job content plateauing, and intention to remain. We conclude that implementing training and development practices targeting older workers and tailored to their needs and providing interesting and challenging job assignments are important to perceptions of organizational support and career satisfaction and ultimately to the retention of older workers.
