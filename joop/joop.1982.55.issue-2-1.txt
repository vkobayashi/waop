The goal-setting research literature is reviewed in an attempt to identify those variables having an effect on an individual's choice of goal level. Two broad areas are considered: situational factors and personality factors. Under situational factors, prior success or failure on the task, monetary and verbal incentives, feedback, participation, and competition are identified as probable determinants of the choice of goal difficulty level. Personality influences, such as need for achievement, higher-order need strength, self-assurance, and maturity are also reviewed, and it is concluded that these variables also influence an individual's choice of goal difficulty. Surprisingly, none of the reviewed studies directly examined the connection between such variables and goal difficulty; nor between goal difficulty and general personality. Thus, the early literature on level of aspiration is examined and the review supports the notion that choice of goal difficulty reflects a general personality trait, operating across different situations. Discussion focuses on the need for research which views goal-setting behaviour as a personality trait, and the problems associated with such an approach.
