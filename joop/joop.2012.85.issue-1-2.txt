Although self-efficacy can exist at multiple levels of specificity (e.g., general self-efficacy, domain-level self-efficacy, and task-specific self-efficacy), the negotiation literature has not explicitly dealt with negotiation self-efficacy at the domain level. We introduce the conceptual background for domain-level negotiation self-efficacy and – in two contrasting studies – demonstrate the construct's ability to predict objective negotiated outcomes. Interestingly, domain-level negotiation self-efficacy predicted negotiation outcomes while task-specific negotiation self-efficacy did not. Implications of this counter-intuitive finding are discussed.
