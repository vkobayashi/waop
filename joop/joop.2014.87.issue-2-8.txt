Drawing upon cognitive appraisal theory and affective events theory, we develop and test a model of discrete emotions, coping, and performance that contains both within- and between-person components. We argue that when employees feel angry, guilty, joyous, or proud at work, those with higher levels of ability-based emotional intelligence will turn to emotion-focused coping as a means to deal with the immediate aftermath of the emotion. This form of coping requires the least amount of cognitive resources and facilitates performance by helping individuals to meet their task demands. Random coefficient modelling findings from daily diary data collected in a law enforcement setting support our proposed ideas concerning the interactive effects of emotions and emotional intelligence on coping, as well as the effects of coping on task performance.
The findings from this study conducted in a law enforcement setting suggest that coping strategies such as venting, denial, and disengagement might be adaptive for short-term performance.Organizations could manage employee emotions via awareness of appropriate coping responses and selecting higher ABEI individuals for jobs that involve emotions on a routine basis.
