Graduating college students (n=105) completed questionnaires following employment interviews at a university placement centre, describing recruiter behaviours, impressions of recruiter warmth and thoughtfulness, and willingness to accept a job offer. The behaviour descriptions were factor analysed, yielding five factors. Multiple regression indicated that three factors (non-directive counselling behaviours, listening skills and interpersonal sensitivity) were related to perceived recruiter warmth and thoughtfulness (R2=0·47) and one factor (listening skills) was related to applicant willingness to accept a job offer (R2=0·13). When applicants perceived that the recruiter was representative of the company, the behaviours of the interviewer were more influential in determining the applicant's willingness to accept a job offer. Applicant sex and age did not moderate the relationship between perceived interviewer behaviours and applicant willingness to accept an offer. Implications of the results for further research and recruiting practices are discussed.
