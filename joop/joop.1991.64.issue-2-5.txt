The conceptualization of leaders as reinforcement mediators is a relatively recent development, which has generated substantial interest in leadership research. Accompanying this new approach has been the development and use of perceived leader reinforcement questionnaires; a rapidly growing literature has developed as a result. This article reports a factor analytic investigation of what is probably the most commonly used and reliable measure in this domain - the Leader Reward and Punishment Questionnaire (LRPQ: Podsakoff, Todor, Grover & Huber, 1984). Using samples of hospital employees (N = 375) and bankers (N = 297), with principal axes factor extraction and varimax rotation, the results show relatively good discriminant validity when the LRPQ is factored with the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire's ‘satisfaction with supervision’ items (MSQ: Weiss, Dawis, England & Lofquist, 1967). A consistent pattern of weak to moderate cross-loadings does exist, however, suggesting that research which employs affective dependent variables may need to interpret cautiously some of the relationships obtained. Avenues for future research are briefly discussed.
