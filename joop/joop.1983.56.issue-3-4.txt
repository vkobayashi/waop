Three hundred and ninety-four personnel selection studies published in the journal Personnel Psychology over a 30-year period (1950â€“1979) were analysed according to selected aspects of the research design. The purpose of the study was to describe and evaluate changes in the conduct of personnel selection research which have occurred during the past three decades. The parameters selected for analysis included (1) type of job performance criteria used; (2) types and number of predictors used; (3) sample size; and (4) jobs studied. The results reveal significant changes in the parameters of personnel selection research over the past 30 years. The findings are discussed in terms of how the literature meets current professional standards for personnel selection research.
