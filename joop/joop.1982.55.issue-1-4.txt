The Worker Opinion Survey, developed by Cross (1973), is a useful job satisfaction instrument with many desirable features. However, it has not been validated to any extent. The present paper reports a study which examined the convergent and discriminant validity of the Worker Opinion Survey in relation to the Job Descriptive Index in a variety of ways. The results supported the validity of the Worker Opinion Survey and strengthened its usefulness as a research instrument.
