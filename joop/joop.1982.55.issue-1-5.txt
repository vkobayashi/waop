The usefulness of reference reports has tended to be neglected in personnel selection research, and available evidence is not encouraging. In the study reported, ratings on the headteacher's report form used in Royal Navy Officer selection were examined and compared with training performance. Although the ratings of candidates (n = 263) were subject to restriction of range and possible leniency effects, amongst entrants (n = 103) a total score derived from the seven individual scales had a correlation (corrected for restriction) of ***0â€“36 with overall training performance. It is concluded that under some circumstances head-teacher's reports can make a useful contribution to the selection process. It is suggested that such predictive power as the ratings have derives from their providing, within carefully constructed format, samples of characteristic behaviour similar to the criterion.
