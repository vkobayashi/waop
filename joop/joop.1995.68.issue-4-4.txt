This study examined the hypothesis that the well-established relationship between hierarchical job level and employee affective outcomes is mediated by perceptions of work and workplace. A total of 228 employees of a large bank completed questionnaires. Analyses of variance and covariance revealed that employee perceptions of control and influence (i.e. work experiences) and perceptions of privacy and crowding (i.e. workplace experiences) accounted for job grade differences in satisfaction and turnover intentions. These results provide support for an application of the Job Characteristics Model, suggest a potential extension of the model, and illustrate the significant effects of employee perceptions of work and workplace on affective outcomes.
