This paper presents results of a study comparing the methods used to select managers in 73 British and 52 French organizations. While larger companies in both countries are more likely to use reliable and valid selection methods, British companies are significantly more likely to do so. These results are discussed in terms of cultural differences. The data are also used to look at changes over time in the use of management selection methods in Britain, comparing these current data with those obtained by Robertson & Makin (1986) in 1984. Results are encouraging since they suggest that methods such as psychological tests, biodata and assessment centres are being used more frequently, although the interview remains dominant.
