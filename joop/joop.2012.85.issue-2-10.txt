Interpersonal Emotion Management (IEM) strategies represent behaviours targeted at managing negative emotions in others. This paper describes the development and validation of the four-dimensional IEM strategies scale. Four studies were conducted to assess the psychometric properties of the scale, including content, discriminant, and criterion validity. Results provided strong support for the four-dimensional measure of IEM strategies, distinct from conceptually related constructs, and predictive of subordinatesâ€™ trust in their supervisor.
