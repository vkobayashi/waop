Using a sample of 146 bank tellers, this study tested the usefulness of locus of control for explaining initiative versus compliant performance. Based upon Spector's (1982) conceptual work, locus of control showed a negative relationship to initiative performance and a positive relationship to compliant performance. However, these results were only found using Spector's (1988) work locus of control measure and not with the Rotter (1966) measure. Spector's work locus of control measure also explained significant performance variance beyond controlled for individual and situational variables. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed.
