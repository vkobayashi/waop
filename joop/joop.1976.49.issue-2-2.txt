Studies on the effects of discussing an individual's strengths and weaknesses in job performance during appraisal interviews have come to widely differing conclusions. Some of the possible reasons for this are discussed and taken account of in this investigation of appraisal interviews in a government department. Interviews perceived as containing varying degrees of performance feedback (both positive and negative, positive only, negative only and none at all) were compared on a number of variables indicating the effectiveness of the appraisal. The results indicate that interviews perceived as containing a balanced review of the individual's strengths and weaknesses in performance achieved the greatest positive effect overall, while those containing no feedback whatsoever achieved relatively little.
