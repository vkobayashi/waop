Burnout is an experience relevant not only to psychosocial professions, but also to technical work. It is predicted that in a technical profession work stressors are related to burnout and that this relationship is moderated by control at work, task requirements, and the quality of team interaction. In a sample of 180 software professionals from 29 software development projects, stressors were found to be positively related to burnout measures. Control at work, complexity at work, and openness to criticism within the team were all found to be significantly negatively related to lack of identification. Moderated regression analyses revealed that high cognitive requirements, high learning requirements, and low competition within the team enhanced the relationship between stressors and burnout.
