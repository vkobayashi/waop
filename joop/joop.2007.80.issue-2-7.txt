Differences between full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) employees have long been of interest to organizational psychologists. While most research assumes PT employees are a single, undifferentiated group, some studies have established the diversity of the PT workforce, particularly in terms of participation in other work and non-work roles. An important gap in this research concerns how different types of PT employees may differ from one another, as well as from FT employees. In this study, we proposed and tested a typology of the PT workforce. We identified several groups of PT employees with substantially different patterns of involvement in school, family, and work roles. The PT groups had generally more favourable job attitudes than did the FT employees. Although the PT groups generally had higher turnover than the FT employees, we found substantial differences among the groups in their turnover behaviour. We discuss the implications of our findings for future work status research and for managing the PT workforce.
