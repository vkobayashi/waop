Extending previous research on group reflexivity as a group level predictor of individual innovation, we examined group reflexivity as a possible moderator of the effect of job control and task complexity on individual innovation. We obtained data on job and group characteristics from 135 members of software development teams; line managers provided ratings on individual innovation. Data were analysed using hierarchical linear modelling. Results lend further support to a positive effect of job design on individual innovation, but no effect was found for group reflexivity. The interplay between job design and group reflexivity reveals a more complex picture. While the positive effect of job control is augmented in the presence of high reflexivity, in contrast, task complexity is negatively associated with innovation in teams with high reflexivity. Results are discussed from a time and cognitive resource perspective. Furthermore, the development of context-specific models on group reflexivity is proposed.
