This study argues that underlying the breadth of research on attitudinal organizational commitment are three dimensions: positive affect for the organization, identification with the organization and a willingness to exert effort on behalf of the organization. Results of confirmatory factor analyses using three different samples support a three-dimensional model as a superior fit to the data when compared with one- or two-dimensional models of attitudinal commitment.
