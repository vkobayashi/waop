The paper assesses a gender-specific model of career success, using human capital attributes, career choices, and opportunity structures as predictors. The model was evaluated in two studies using a sample of managers from a public sector organization, and a sample of British employees from the general workforce. The results demonstrated the need for gender-specific models, as the paths to career success vary between the sexes. The importance attached to specific predictors of career success varied between men and women. Job-specific attributes influenced more the career success of men; whereas women's achievements were obtained more through job-relevant merits, career-move decisions and organizational and occupational opportunities' structures. The results and their implications for future studies of career success are discussed.
