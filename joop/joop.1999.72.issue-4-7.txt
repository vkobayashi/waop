This one-year follow-up study focused on the impact of labour market interventions (i.e. guidance courses, vocational training and subsidized employment) on re-employment, job-seeking activity and psychological distress of the unemployed. Another aim was to investigate how individual factors, especially one's financial situation, are related to re-employment, job-seeking activity and psychological distress. The results show that participation in guidance courses predicted re-employment, whereas vocational training and subsidized employment did not have any effect on re-employment. Of the individual factors, job-seeking activity, and being married or co-habiting in a steady relationship, predicted reemployment. None of the studied interventions increased job-seeking activity. Deterioration of one's financial situation between the two measurement points was related to an increase in job-seeking activity. Vocational training decreased temporarily psychological distress and a deterioration of one's financial situation was related to an increase in distress. Guidance, which focuses on job-seekers' skills, job-search process and labour market knowledge, should be emphasized more.
