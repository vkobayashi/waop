This paper presents results into gender differences and potential adverse impact on Belbin's original BTRSPI. Based on a sample of 311 sales and customer service representatives (208 females, 103 males), a series of descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric tests are reported. Findings suggest significant differences between genders in response patterns favouring males on the team roles of Chair, Shaper, and Plant. Conversely, females scored significantly higher on the role of Team Worker. Implications for potential adverse impact, Four-Fifths Rule differences, and the use of Belbin's questionnaire for selection, particularly into team leader positions, are raised.
