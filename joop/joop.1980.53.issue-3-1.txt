First-year students in three engineering subfields were compared in terms of reported stage of both field (engineering) and subfield choice as well as on several biographical variables. There were some differences, albeit insignificant, in stage at which the field was chosen. However, significant differences were found in stage of subfield choice: electrical engineering students (EE) chose the subfield earlier than did either mechanical (ME) or industrial engineering (IE) students. EE essentially made a one-step choice of both field and subfield, whereas ME and IE, despite differences between them, made a two-step choice process: the subfield was selected at a later stage than was the field itself.
