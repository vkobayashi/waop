The Worker Opinion Survey (WOS) is a multifaceted scale measuring job satisfaction with a simple yes/no/not-sure mode of response. Exploratory techniques were originally used to define the scales and judgemental techniques were used to derive the scoring. In the present study, based on a broad sample of 636 government employees, three possible models for the dimensionality of the WOS were compared using confirmatory factor analysis, and variants on the scoring system were evaluated using a Rasch model. The six-factor solution of Cross was confirmed as most appropriate (with correlated factors) but it was found that the scoring system could be improved by considering ‘not-sure’ responses differently for different subscales.
