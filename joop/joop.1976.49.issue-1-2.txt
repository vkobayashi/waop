A great deal of research has been conducted over recent years in the field of occupational stress and its relationship to physical and mental illness. This paper attempts to provide a framework for examining this work, with the dual objectives of broadening the existing psychological literature with the extensive medical data available and also highlighting the research gaps in this area. By emphasizing the medical evidence it is hoped that we may encourage greater interdisciplinary work in the growing field of stress at work.
