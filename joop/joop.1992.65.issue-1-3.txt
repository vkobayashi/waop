The paper describes a series of surveys which dealt with the response of employers and trade unions to sexual harassment, together with an analysis of cases dealt with by the Equal Opportunities Commission for Northern Ireland. The surveys considered issues including training, policy, publicity and perception of sexual harassment by designated personnel. Results indicated wide variations in response amongst representatives of trade unions and private and public sector employers, and a general lack of coordination between organizations. The difficulties in defining and ultimately pursuing cases of sexual harassment are discussed in the light of these findings.
