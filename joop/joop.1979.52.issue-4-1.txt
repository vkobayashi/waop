Content analyses of 10 principal journals relevant to industrial and organizational psychology are presented, covering 1 582 papers published in the years 1976 to 1978 inclusive. One analysis is in terms of the topic areas covered (personnel psychology, human factors psychology, occupational social psychology, and six other categories), and a second examination is in terms of three types of paper: empirical research study, critique or review, or suggested procedures and methods. Data are also provided about the length of articles in each journal, and the location and number of authors. Factual comparisons between journals are followed by a summary of the current policy of the Journal of Occupational Psychology.
