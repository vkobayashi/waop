Within research on the quality of working life the variables of trust, organizational commitment and the fulfilment of personal needs play an important part. Yet relevant measures with adequate psychometric support are difficult to locate, especially ones applicable to blue-collar British working populations. The present paper introduces new measures of these variables, each of which has a number of subscales. Internal homogeneity, reliability and factor analytic data are described which show the scales to be psychometrically adequate and stable. To support the future use of the measures for diagnostic and evaluative purposes, normative data are also provided.
