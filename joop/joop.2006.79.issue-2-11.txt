To complement environment-centred perspectives on employee well-being, which primarily examine the characteristics of external stimuli, a two-component framework is presented of cognitive processes in responding to those stimuli. First, it is argued that the experience of well-being derives in part from up to eight kinds of judgment, which operate on an environmental input. These judgments include comparisons with other people, alternative situations and other times, and assessments against three personal reference points: significance for self, relevant self-efficacy, and novelty or familiarity. The framework's second component sets out situational and personal factors that may differentially promote activation of the judgments. Evidence is reviewed for each judgment's role in well-being and for the proposed activation contingencies, and a research agenda is presented.
