Using a sample of 119 registered nurses from a large urban hospital, this longitudinal study investigated the nomological network of career commitment by: (a) determining if a distinct measure of career commitment could be operationalized, and (b) examining whether such a measure showed a different relationship to withdrawal cognition scales than measures of other work commitment concepts. The study also tested the importance of situational and individual difference variables in predicting career commitment.
