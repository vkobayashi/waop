An experimental technique for developing scoring keys for a biographical inventory was applied to the analysis of responses on a questionnaire completed by applicants for refinery operating jobs. The technique differed from more traditional empirical methods used to key biographical data in that it was not dependent on itemâ€“criterion relationships. The chief aims were to determine whether relatively independent and homogeneous keys could be constructed with this method and whether the resulting keys were useful in predicting job success. The analysis yielded 12 keys which were relatively independent and homogeneous. The results tentatively suggested that such keys may be comparable in predictive power to empirically derived keys which are less easily interpretable.
