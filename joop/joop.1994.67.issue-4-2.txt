A Personal Construct Psychology framework and repertory grids were used in a longitudinal study designed to analyse the qualitative and evaluative nature of change in graduates' self construction during the six months following organizational entry. In line with the hypotheses guiding the research, the results suggest that graduates undertook some important qualitative change in self-construction, but that these trends of change reflected individual developmental paths rather than a common socialization effect; change took place through both the development of new core role constructs, and change in self-ratings on stable constructs (slot change). The study provides some modest support for the hypothesis concerning the positive relationship between self-esteem and role meaningfulness (challenge, responsibility, autonomy, workload and the extent to which work is worthwhile and interesting). However, the initial level of self-esteem does not appear to moderate the effect of low role meaningfulness on subsequent level of self-esteem, a finding which fails to support our hypothesis.
