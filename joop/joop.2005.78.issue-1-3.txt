This study investigated whether a preventive, group-based job search program has long-term beneficial effects on the re-employment and mental health of participants who have been unemployed for a prolonged period of time. A total of 1,227 unemployed Finnish job seekers participated in this randomly assigned experimental field study. Participation in the programme significantly decreased symptoms of depression, and increased the self-esteem of the participants during the 2 years of follow-up. Compared to the control group, the participants of the experimental group were engaged significantly more often in the labour market, either employed, or participating in vocational training.
