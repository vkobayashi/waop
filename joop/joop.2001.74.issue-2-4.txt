The similarity-attraction paradigm suggests that congruence between the cognitive styles of managers and their subordinates may result in positive leader-member relationships. A study of 142 manager-subordinate dyads in two large manufacturing organizations fails to support this idea. Findings suggest, however, that intuitive leaders may be less dominating and more nurturing than their analytic colleagues, and that they are more liked and respected by analytic members than analytic leaders are by intuitive members. Results also indicate that the degree of difference between leader and member cognitive styles may influence the nature of the relationship. Practical implications depend on whether cognitive style is stable or malleable.
