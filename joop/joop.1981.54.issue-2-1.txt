The principles and history of the assessment centre method are briefly examined and the key nature of the simulation exercise in it discussed. Evidence on the inter-rater reliability of evaluations based on one class of simulation (group exercises) is reviewed. Four studies are reported showing mean inter-rater reliability coefficients for summary evaluations between 0.65 and 0.73 for two types of exercises before pooling evaluations and between 0.67 and 0.86 for four types of exercises after pooling evaluations of candidates. The implications of these results and possible ways of improving inter-rater reliability are discussed. The need for work on the repeat, alternate form, and internal consistency reliabilities of group exercises is raised.
