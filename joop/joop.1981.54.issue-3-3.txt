The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of intended supervisory behaviours on employee perceptions of task characteristics. The subjects were 29 first-line manufacturing supervisors and two employees of each supervisor. To measure intended supervisory behaviours, interviews were conducted with each supervisor, while perceptions of task characteristics were obtained by questionnaire from the subordinates. Results indicated a very high level of convergence between intended supervisory behaviours and employee perceptions of their tasks. Implications for future task design research are discussed.
