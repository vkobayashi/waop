Several studies, simulated and actual, have found that job applicants return higher scores on distortion scales in personality questionnaires than similar people who are not undergoing selection; this has been attributed to motivation. This study examines the test results of more than 700 male and female subjects in a variety of real-life selection programmes. It concludes that distortion is related to the stress of the circumstances in which testing takes place, and suggests a modified interpretation of the role of lie scales.
