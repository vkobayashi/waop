A group of women employed under a flexible working time schedule was compared with a group of women from the same organization employed under a rigid (fixed) schedule, with respect to overall work satisfaction, strain reactions and absenteeism rates. Marital status and parenthood were used as moderator variables. Neither main effects nor significant moderator effects were found for the individual outcomes as criteria. Absenteeism rates were significantly lower under the flexible than the rigid work schedule and married women and mothers had the lowest rates of absenteeism when employed under a flexible schedule.
