One reason for Annett, et al.'s technique of hierarchical task analysis not being more widely adopted is that would-be analysts have failed to understand the concept of ‘redescription’. It is argued that the original tabular format proposed for recording such analyses has not facilitated this understanding. For example, the table does not enable easy examination of the redescription of a superordinate operation, nor is there a clear separation between the basic task analysis and hypotheses proposed to ensure operator competence. A revised format is proposed to overcome these objections and is illustrated using a complex planning task.
