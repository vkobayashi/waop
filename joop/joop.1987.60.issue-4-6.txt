This study explored the relationship between attributional style and mental health in a sample of 63 unemployed managers. Regression analysis indicated that managers who tended to make characterological attributions for negative events had poor mental health, as measured by the General Health Questionnaire, but managers making behavioural attributions (for positive and negative events) had better mental health. High expressed need for a job was also associated with poor mental health. The role of attributional styles as coping mechanisms is briefly discussed.
