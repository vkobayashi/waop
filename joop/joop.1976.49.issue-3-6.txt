Using personality and demographic variables of 75 adult career management clients and non-clients, multiple discriminant analysis successfully (P <0Â·01) discriminated among levels of usage of career management services (maximum, average, minimum users, and drop-outs). The minimum user group's centroid was distinctly separated from those of the other three groups, which clustered together. Maximum users were found to be more methodical and participative, minimum users less self-assured, and drop-outs more enterprising. The fact that the centroids of the maximum and drop-out groups clustered together was accounted for by the directional correspondence of the common underlying dimension of assertiveness.
