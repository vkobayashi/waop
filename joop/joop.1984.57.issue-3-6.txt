This study investigated, in the field, differences in the transfer and retention of training in using micrometers, of two groups of young trainees. The experimental group were motor-vehicle servicing trainees and the control group were information technology trainees. The results showed that (i) there was no difference between trainees of the two groups in end-of-training tests when they were trained from scratch, though the information technology trainees retained the skill better; (ii) experimental subjects, who had learned the micrometer skill one year previously, were more effectively trained to use it in a new trade than were control subjects, who lacked previous experience; (iii) experimental subjects, who had learned the micrometer skill one year previously, were not more effectively trained to use a vernier height-gauge. Results are discussed in terms of the level of skill at which a possible transfer mechanism may be supposed to operate. Evidence is presented of effective transfer of training between two skills very closely related at the motor level. Failure of transfer of training between two skills related at a somewhat higher level of abstraction is shown. The question of transfer of training between two skills not closely related at these lower levels, but related at a yet higher level of abstraction, is discussed.
