Despite much research on the relationship between unemployment and mental health, consideration of the relationship between economic and psychological problems remains remarkedly rare.
Available evidence suggests that income affects psychological well-being indirectly via subjectively appraised financial strain.
This paper presents an analysis of the relationships between measures of household income and resources, subjectively appraised financial strain and psychological distress drawing on a nationally representative sample of 3294 households in the Republic of Ireland.
Our analysis demonstrates that objectively assessed exclusion from customary lifestyles, involving deprivation of socially defined necessities, is associated with increased psychological distress.
