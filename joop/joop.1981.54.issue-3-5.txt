The nature, aetiology, and development of general work values of those in or interested in the police occupation were examined in a cross-sectional study. Police science students (n = 261) were compared to a current police officer group (n = 169) on the Survey of Work Values and on demographic variables. Results indicated: (1) the student and current officer groups differed from previously studied samples on the Survey of Work Values; (2) students differed significantly from the officer group on the work values of activity preference and attitude towards earnings; (3) within the student sample, work values correlated with ethnic status, sex, education, and marital status; and (4) within the police sample, work values correlated with age and rank. Results are discussed in terms of socialization, selection, and organizational processes.
