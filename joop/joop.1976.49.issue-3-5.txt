Twenty-four neutral observers evaluated the performance of candidates in two mock selection interviews. Unknown to the observers, candidates received nonverbal approval from one interviewer and non-verbal disapproval from the other. Candidates were perceived as more comfortable and at ease in the approval interview and were also judged to have created a better impression. The results were discussed in terms of the possibility that an interviewer's non-verbal style may significantly influence the behaviour of the candidate he is trying to evaluate.
