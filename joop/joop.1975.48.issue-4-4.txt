The problem of applying appropriate teaching strategies for individual learning disabilities is analysed particularly in relation to industrial rehabilitation and training schemes. An approach has been developed whereby research evidence from the psychology of individual differences, educational technology and training is collated to produce Instructional Strategy Templates (ISTs). These serve to guide Rehabilitation and Training Instructors towards the adoption of the most suitable teaching strategies available for specific learner characteristics.
