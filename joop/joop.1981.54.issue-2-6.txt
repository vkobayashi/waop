This study compared two widely used forms of interest inventory itemâ€”the job title and the job activity. It was found that, contrary to the claims of questionnaire designers, interest patterns resulting from job titles are almost identical to those resulting from job activities. Scales employing job titles evoke marginally more consistent and stable responses amongst schoolchildren, but neither approach offers a substantial advantage in reducing the effects of perceived status or sex bias. Discrepancies between responses to the two forms are likely to be the product of several influences requiring further investigation in a guidance interview.
