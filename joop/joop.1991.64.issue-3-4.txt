The purpose of this study was to investigate how reported subordinate upward influencing behaviour varies with perceived quality of leader-member exchanges (LMX). Subordinate upward influence effectiveness, satisfaction with the superior and superior effectiveness were also of interest. It was predicted that higher quality LMX would be positively associated with the use of bargaining, reason and friendliness (Hypothesis 1), and negatively related to the use of higher authority, coalition and assertiveness (Hypothesis 2) upward influence strategies. It was further predicted that higher quality LMX would be associated with upward subordinate influence effectiveness (Hypothesis 3), subordinate satisfaction with the superior and superior effectiveness (Hypothesis 4). Three hundred and seventy-six subjects (average age = 33.58 years) completed several measures assessing the target variables. Hierarchical multiple regression confirmed Hypotheses 2, 3 and 4. Hypothesis 1 was not supported. These findings are discussed in terms of superior-subordinate influencing dynamics and the advantages of higher quality LMX.
