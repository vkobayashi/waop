A detailed review is presented of studies bearing on the performance and effectiveness of Japanese managers, with particular attention to comparative data. Japanese managers within Japan are found to show continuing marked differences from those within other countries. These differences are not easily conceptualized within established Western models of management style and systems of decision making, and are thus frequently misunderstood. Japanese firms in the West are found to utilize only some of the practices used in Japan. Researchers in this field have often failed to distinguish between the occurrence of a particular behaviour and the manner in which it is interpreted within and between particular cultures. The similarities and differences between effective management in Japan and in the West will only become clear when studies are undertaken which make such distinctions.
