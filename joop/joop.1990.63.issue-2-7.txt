The present study was designed to initiate evaluation of an in-basket measure of managerial participative decision making, examine the organization of participative behaviours, and examine the relations between participative tendency and six personality traits selected from the Personality Research Form (PRF; Jackson, 1986) and the Jackson Personality Inventory (JPI; Jackson, 1976). In-basket responses from 78 Canadian managers were coded for six participative behaviours: (1) delegation, (2) seeking advice, (3) following advice, (4) requesting to meet with an individual, (5) seeking non-advisory information, and (6) asking to be kept informed as to how a problem is developing. Results showed that these behaviours are reliably measured with an in-basket simulation, and supported a unidimensional interpretation of participative tendency as an individual difference variable. As predicted, PRF-cognitive structure was negatively related to participative tendency; but contrary to prediction, both PRF-autonomy and PRF-dominance correlated positively with participative tendency. Interpretations of these findings call for research into the role of authority-threatening situations in moderating the links between PDM and power-based motives. Implications for personnel decision making are discussed.
