We tested the relationship between individuals' expertise recognition and work performance, the role of job resourcefulness (i.e. individuals' ability to garner resources to overcome obstacles) as a mediator, and network recognition as a moderator in the link between expertise recognition and job resourcefulness. We found that the positive impact of expertise recognition on work performance was mediated by job resourcefulness, but network recognition did not play a moderating role.
