The study was designed to determine motives and personality characteristics associated with differential rates of farm output. Three analyses were undertaken: (1) intergroup comparisons for the mean scores obtained after dichotomizing the sample (n = 400) at the median increase in farm output; (2) Comparisons of the extreme 10 per cent with highest and lowest farm output; (3) brothers who were in the above-median and below-median groups. All the analyses indicated that nAch and a few related variables were positively associated with progressive farm behaviour, while anxiety and religious interest were negatively linked.
