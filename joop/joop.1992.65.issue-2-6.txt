This study investigated the agreement between superior and subordinate performance ratings and the correlations between these performance ratings and standardized measures of job satisfaction. Subjects were 261 members of the fire service, representing three ranks in the organizational hierarchy: chiefs (N = 12), captains (N = 76), and firefighters (N = 173). Subjects completed performance ratings of both their superiors and subordinates, and standardized measures of job satisfaction. Results indicated significant agreement between superior (chief) and subordinate (firefighter) ratings of captains' performance. These performance ratings were also positively correlated with both subordinate (firefighter) and supervisor (captain) job satisfaction, particularly satisfaction with supervisors and with co-workers.
