Expectancy models have related individual work values and the availability of desired rewards in different occupations to occupational preferences, while self-efficacy models have stressed personal perceptions of individual capacities to perform in different occupations to occupational preferences. This study demonstrates support for both models, and indicates that these models have separate and independent relationships to occupational preference. Further analysis supports the contention that the perceptions of self-efficacy may be an important factor in explaining sex differences in occupational preferences.
