Nervous strain at work amongst a sample of 1415 men, all 26 year old members of the National Survey of Health and Development, was found to relate both to their predisposition to anxiety and to their own report of day-to-day activities in their job. Level of work was the dominant factor in the analysis, men in high-level jobs being more likely to report nervous strain than men in manual work. Susceptibility to anxiety and specific work factors (supervising, teaching, contact with people, driving, skilled machine work) made approximately equal contributions to the rate of reported strain, after allowance for the level of work. Little evidence was found that stressful jobs were held by particularly anxious men and it was concluded that predisposing and precipitating factors made largely independent contributions to the report of nervous strain at work in this sample of workers.
