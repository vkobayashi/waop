In the development of police officer authoritarianism, importation variables do not appear decisive. Police recruit authoritarianism is no different from that of fire service recruits with a similar background. Initial training, however, depresses authoritarianism despite the unambiguous emphasis in training on law and discipline. Finally, experience of on-the-beat policing leads to a dramatic increase in authoritarianism in a traditionally policed area with a high crime rate, but not in a low crime rate area with an emphasis on community policing.
