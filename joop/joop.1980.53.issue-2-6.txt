Trainability testing is examined in the context of more general research on work-sampling. Links between trainability testing and theoretical issues concerning point-to-point correspondence between predictor and criterion are discussed. Results of an experiment examining the value of trainability tests in six craft trades are presented. They indicate that, in general, the tests used exhibit acceptable levels of predictive validity over a 3 week follow-up period. Potential uses and areas where further research is needed are also discussed.
