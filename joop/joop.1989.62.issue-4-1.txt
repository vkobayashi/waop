Mismatches between person and environment following a work-role transition are considered in the light of a theory of such transitions. The effects of role requirements, socialization processes and personality were examined among 145 student nurses at various stages in their training, using questionnaire and diary recording methods. A number of theoretical predictions were borne out, but of particular interest were the findings that those with high desire for control entering the low discretion environment of student nursing were more likely than others to role innovate but they also evidenced greater levels of personal change, surprise and emotional frustration. It is suggested that adjustment to mismatches following work-role transitions fosters high levels of personal change and attempted role innovation but that low discretion environments in particular hinder such adjustments, leading to frustration and intentions to turnover.
