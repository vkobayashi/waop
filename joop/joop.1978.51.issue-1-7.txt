The information and advice needed by adults engaged in mid-career change are analysed in terms of how they may be expected to differ from those required by younger people. Some of the modifications to computer-assisted guidance programs and data banks which would be required to take account of these differences are then suggested in outline. Ways in which implementation of these developments in guidance systems have been made possible in the USA are discussed: techniques for cooperation between agencies at local level, and consideration of unit size appear important. The availability of a range of guidance services—both computer-assisted and personal—is seen as contributing substantially to adults' capacity for self-management of both career and lifestyle.
