British studies of the effectiveness of careers guidance are reviewed in three groups: studies of diagnostic accuracy, studies of the effectiveness of diagnostic guidance interventions, and studies of the effectiveness of developmental guidance interventions. Methodological limitations are noted, and particular attention is paid to the paucity and inadequacy of the studies in the latter group, despite the trend towards a more developmental approach to careers guidance in recent years. The problem of finding adequate criterion measures is discussed.
