Robertson & Kinder (1993) carried out an exploration of the criterion-related validity of some personality variables as measured by the Occupational Personality Questionnaire. Using meta-analytic integrations of validity coefficients, they suggested that in some circumstances personality measures can fail as predictors of job performance. Although their estimation of the average validity for each criterion area is correct, their estimation of sampling error is based on a computational error. The error influenced the estimation of the residual variance and the 90 per cent credibility values. A reanalysis using the data reported by Robertson & Kinder shows that, against the Robertson & Kinder conclusions, the OPQ generalizes its validity for 11 criterion areas and the lower boundary of the credibility values are substantially far from zero in all cases, except for the energy area. If the Robertson & Kinder findings are taken together with those of this reanalysis, the results offer support for the criterion-related validity of personality variables.
