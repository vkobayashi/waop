Physiological and psychological instruments were used in the measurement of stress in an occupational training situation. The physiological instrument, the measurement of capilliary blood glucose levels, showed a progressive increase throughout the period of the exercise being observed. The psychological instrument, a stress and arousal adjective checklist (SACL), showed no significant changes in arousal but did show a significant drop in the level of reported stress across the task period. Correlational analysis permits the construction of a model which describes the relationship between the measures and also the results obtained. Changes in the training course are suggested which may alleviate some of the stressfulness perceived by the trainees.
