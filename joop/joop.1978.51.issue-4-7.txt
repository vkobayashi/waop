The study examined the reactions of 63 supervisors within 12 work units of a large eastern United States insurance company to a 4 month experimental flexible working hours programme. The supervisors perceived a positive impact on productivity of their units, employee honesty, unit administration, employee time handling and employee work habits. Some possible negative consequences and areas for future research are discussed.
