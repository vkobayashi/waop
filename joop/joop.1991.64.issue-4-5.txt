Despite continued interest in occupational stress research at least three issues continue to confront researchers. These include the way work stress is operationalized; the measurement of work stressors and the role of coping in work-stress research. The aim of this study is to develop a framework which clearly reflects these contemporary issues. It incorporates this perspective into work-stress research by exploring the way in which individuals cognitively appraise and cope with stressful encounters. The results clearly establish the significant role that appraisals and coping play. More particularly they point to the potential benefits for work-stress research that can be derived from this sort of approach. Further construct refinement and methodological developments can only add to what must become a more conceptually integrated body of knowledge.
