Random samples of 2149 men and 1206 women in mainland United Kingdom were asked whether they would continue in employment if that were no longer financially necessary. Subsidiary questions asked whether those opting to continue in employment would change jobs, and whether those opting out might later return to employment. Sixty-nine per cent of full-time male employees and 65 per cent of full-time female employees responded affirmatively to the principal question. Significant age and socio-economic status effects were observed. Data are also presented for part-time employed, retired and unemployed subsamples; in the latter case respondents are classified in terms of whether or not they are currently looking for employment. Comparisons are drawn with results from the USA, where non-financial employment commitment among men appears to be slightly higher; however, that could be a reflection of a temporal gap between investigations. The present data are proposed as a base-line for future comparisons.
