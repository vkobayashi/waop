Hackett & Betz (1981) proposed that Bandura's (1977) theory of self-efficacy can provide a useful conceptual framework in which to view the occupational preferences of women. They suggested that, largely due to socialization experiences, women have low self-efficacy expectations in relation to traditionally male occupations, and that this may contribute to women's continued underrepresentation in these occupations. A total of 121 current and prospective university students rated their self-efficacy for, their liking of, and the extent to which they had considered entering, various traditionally male and traditionally female occupations. The females displayed lower self-efficacy than the males for all but one of the traditionally male occupations. The males did not lack self-efficacy in relation to the majority of the traditionally female occupations. However, contrary to expectations, women's lower self-efficacy did not deter them from considering entering traditionally male occupations. The implications of these findings are discussed and some of the assumptions underlying the self-efficacy theory of women's occupational preference are questioned.
