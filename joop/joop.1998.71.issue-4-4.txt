Bass's (1985) proposition that transformational leadership can be defined by distinct constructs (charisma, intellectual stimulation and individualized consideration) was tested. Using LISREL 8 confirmatory factor analysis, a three-factor first-order model (Model 1) was compared with a single-factor model (Model 2) and a hierarchical model (Model 3). The sample consisted of 1440 subordinates who worked in Australia for an international bank. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-5X; Avolio, Bass & Jung, 1995) was used to assess transformational leadership. The findings showed that a multidimensional first-order model and a hierarchical model both fitted the data. Based on the evidence presented, it was argued that the MLQ assesses a single higher order construct of transformational leadership and that there is little evidence to support the contention that the MLQ measures distinct transformational leader behaviours.
