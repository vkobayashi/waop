Most training programmes seem to have a short time perspective. They are geared to train a person for his first job, but then essentially leave him on his own. It is argued that, by clustering jobs and identifying requirements common to a number of jobs, and then by structuring the training programme so as to enable the person to transfer knowledge in these common areas from job to job, it would be possible to prepare a person for his whole work career by training him for a number of jobs at once. Strategies and approaches are discussed and evaluated, and suggestions are made. In general, this approach seems not only feasible, but practical, and is worthy of further consideration.
