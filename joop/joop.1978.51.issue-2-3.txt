This study proposes a theoretical framework for the characterization of the stereotype accountant based on J. L. Holland's theory (1973). Contrary to other works on the subject, the purpose of this paper is to trace the stereotype accountant in the framework of an inclusive theory of professional stereotypes. Empirical evidence is presented which contrasts accountancy students with psychology students in both vocational interests and inclinations towards conformity and adherence to socially accepted values.
