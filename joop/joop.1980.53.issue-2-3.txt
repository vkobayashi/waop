Research into interviews has largely been ignored by organizations, perhaps because the findings are fragmented and difficult to translate into meaningful improvements. The initial research concern was with the outcome of the interview, which was superseded by an interest in its content, with little attention being paid to the interview process. This has led to erroneous assumptions by researchers concerning the nature of the interview, assumptions that have ‘dehumanized’ the process.
Considering the ‘good’ interviewer as one who possesses some of the attributes of the ‘good’ counsellor might be fruitful. If this is the case, organizations wishing to improve their interview efficiency would at least have an identifiable solution at their disposal: they could either recruit only interviewers believed to possess these attributes, or develop them in their existing selection staff.
