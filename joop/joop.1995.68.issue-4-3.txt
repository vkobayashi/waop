The development and construct validation of a 12-item career entrenchment measure is reported. Taking a theory-driven approach, three dimensions comprising career entrenchment were defined: a career investments dimension reflecting accumulated investments in one's career success that would be lost or deemed worthless if one were to pursue a new career, an emotional costs dimension assessing the anticipated emotional costs associated with pursuing a new career, and a limitedness of career alternatives dimension gauging the perceived lack of available options for pursuing a new career. Using a combination of methodological procedures, these three dimensions were investigated in two pilot studies and a field test. Results support the intended measure's reliability and validity. Implications for individuals and their careers are discussed.
