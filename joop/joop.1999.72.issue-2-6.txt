Much of the research on the work-strain relationship utilizes models which are narrowly focused on only a few job characteristics. These models are often global in their approach, failing to account for specific situations. Addressing these two issues, the present study investigated the influence of seven job characteristics; namely work control and six sources of work pressure, across a range of occupations, on mental and physical ill-health. Pooled within-group correlations were performed on data from 7099 employees from 13 occupations to clarify which of the seven job characteristics were significantly associated with both mental and physical ill-health. Results indicated all seven variables were significantly important. Mean score and correlational analyses for each occupation revealed many differences between the groups, with some job characteristics significantly associated with mental and physical ill-health in one occupation but not in another. It was concluded that to understand fully the work-strain relationship, research should incorporate a greater range of variables which are specific to a particular workplace. Using more job-specific models, encompassing a range of identified job and organizational stressors would also be more effective, practically, for interventions in the workplace to improve worker health and well-being.
