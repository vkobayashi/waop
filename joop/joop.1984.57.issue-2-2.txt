The mobilization of trade union members to participate in the activities of their union is a complex process of persuading and activating. Curiously, the literature on union participation has paid little attention to this process. In this paper an expectancy-value theory of willingness to participate in action is presented. Central to this theory is the assumption that the willingness to participate in an activity or action of a trade union is a function of the perceived costs and benefits for participants of involvement in that activity or action. In the light of this theory two kinds of mobilization are distinguished: consensus mobilization and action mobilization. The theory was applied in studying three mobilization campaigns of a Dutch trade union: (a) a campaign concerning an imminent conflict about a planned reorganization, and (b) two campaigns over the annual negotiations for a collective labour agreement. This paper describes the developed theory and uses results from the three studies to test and illustrate it.
