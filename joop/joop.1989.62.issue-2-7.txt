Previous predominantly cross-sectional research on antecedents and outcomes of career decidedness has been voluminous but inconclusive. A longitudinal study with two cohorts of undergraduates and recent graduates (n = 124 and n = 157) is described. Using aspects of psychological well-being as dependent variables, the study demonstrates how research design can be improved and empirically examines the value of these improvements. Decidedness and well-being were significantly related especially around graduation, when sustaining a decision led to high levels of well-being. Explanations for the results and the implications of this study for the design of future research on career decidedness are examined.
