Using conservation of resources theory as a guide, this study examines why individuals with an internal locus of control (LOC) are more likely to feel embedded in their organizations. Two mediating processes are posited. First, people with high internal LOC are more likely to acquire greater work resources because they are more effective in negotiating and receiving employment deals which are not widely available or replicable elsewhere. Second, people with high internal LOC are more likely to acquire additional work resources because they network more proactively with colleagues and supervisors. Consequently, high LOC individuals are likely to become more embedded because they have more links with their colleagues and the sacrifices associated with leaving their jobs would be greater. The proposed model was tested and supported with three waves of data collected from a sample of 375 managerial respondents over an 8-month period. Implications for future research, especially the role of personality traits in understanding organizational embeddedness, are also discussed.
