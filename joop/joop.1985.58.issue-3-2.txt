The predictive validities of pre- and post-discussion assessment centre ratings of suitability for initial training as a Naval Officer were compared. The criterion measures were assessments of technical knowledge and officer qualities made on the completion of training. No differences in validity were observed, even for cases where the discussion resulted in more change or where assessors initially disagreed. The value of the discussion procedure for improving predictive validity is questioned.
