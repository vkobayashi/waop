To explore the effect of faked responses on assessors' judgements 12 experienced subjects (psychologists and personnel officers) were asked to rate six 16 PF profiles. These comprised three pairs, in each of which one profile was distorted to the extent of a selection set found in earlier research. The ratings for the three distorted profiles were significantly better than those for the undistorted. It is concluded that faking on 16 PF may affect judgements based on the test.
