In the present study, two models were tested that can improve understanding of the link between participation in decision-making and organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB). In Model 1, it is assumed that perceived supervisory support mediates the link between participation in decision-making and OCB. In Model 2, organizational commitment is presented as the mediator variable. The sample (N = 142) was drawn from employees from 10 departments of a medium-sized trade company in the Netherlands. To improve the reliability of the results, the data were subjected to multilevel analyses. Because no link was observed between commitment and OCB, Model 2 was rejected. In contrast, Model 1 was supported by the data, suggesting that participation in decision-making promotes employees' sense of supervisory support to them, which made employees more likely to reciprocate by exhibiting OCB.
