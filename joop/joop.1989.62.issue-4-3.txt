Achievement motivation (nAch) has been suggested by a number of researchers to be based on a number of underlying factors. Yet no one scale has been developed that incorporates all the factors suggested. This research set out to develop such a scale for research usage. Over three studies, a 49-item scale was produced which measures seven factors. These are Work Ethic (WE), Acquisitiveness (for money) (Acq), Dominance (Dom), Excellence (the pursuit of) (Exc), Competitiveness (Com), Status Aspiration (SA) and Mastery (Mast). Some data on the internal reliability and validity of the scales are included, and some implications of a multifactorial approach to nAch are briefly discussed.
The Regular Commissions Board is the main mechanism for the selection of British Army officers. This study is the most comprehensive validation of that mechanism that has been undertaken. Current selection, training and reporting procedures were investigated and all types of male entrant were sampled. The validation utilized both training and job performance criteria. Within-study meta-analyses were carried out on the entrant and Corps subgroups. Total group validity coefficients of 0.33 (0.43 with resignations excluded), 0.31 and 0.31 were obtained for the prediction of regimental performance, and general officer and specialist training respectively. It is concluded that, given the current applicant population, the Regular Commissions Board is a fair, moderately valid method for the selection of officers, and it has utility. Observations are made concerning the basis of the Board's validity, and the value and design of assessment centres.
