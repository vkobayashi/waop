This study, conducted amongst 121 employees in two hospitals, examines sources of variability in two common measures of absence: frequency and time-lost. Time series analyses over a five-year span suggest substantial differences by month, season and year. More specifically, the analysis of variance of the frequency measure reveals significant differences between seasons and years and a significant season by year interaction. Peak frequencies are systematically recorded during the winter season, while the lowest occur in summer. These trends are less prominent with the time-lost measure, with only the seasonal differences remaining significant. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for the study and measurement of absenteeism.
