To fully understand any system, something about the nature of the complex interactions between the different levels of that system needs to be examined. Two hundred and forty-five responses from the staff of a large British university were randomly selected and surveyed on their perceptions of job satisfaction, workload, participant decision management, and attitudes after a large change to the structure of teaching. In addition, information on various possible organizational moderators was obtained. An interaction was found between two levels of that system, workload (psychological) and occupation position (organizational structure), in relation to job satisfaction. This interaction indicated that support staff actually became more satisfied as their workload increased, whereas the converse were true for academic staff.
