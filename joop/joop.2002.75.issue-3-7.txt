Organizational commitment can help explain a range of human attitudes and behaviours at work and the measurement of this construct is central to explaining such organizational linkages. The purpose of this article is to re-examine the dimensionality of Cook and Wall's (1980) British Organizational Commitment Scale (BOCS) and further to examine the extent to which it holds good in several organizational contexts. The outcomes suggest that the six-item version (all positive) remains superior and is robust across the three organizations studied, although factor covariances and loadings differ.
