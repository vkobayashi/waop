This paper examines the idea that in negotiation groups the balance between interparty and interpersonal exchange varies with time. It is shown that, in an industrial wage negotiation observed by one of the authors, negotiators from both sides became less identifiable in terms of party affiliation from one session to the next. Using a specially designed category system it is demonstrated that, in contrast to what occurs in problem-solving groups, a negotiation group characteristically shows a reduction in conflict with time. Implications of these and other findings for theory and practice are briefly discussed.
