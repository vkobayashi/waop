Although considerable research attention has been directed at understanding perceptions of salary fairness, very little attention has been given to how salary expectations are formed or how trivial elements of the job search context may influence these expectations. Two experiments demonstrated how the simple manipulation of response options for a multiple-choice item may influence subsequent salary expectations and salary satisfaction. Results are discussed in light of Parducci's (1995) contextual theory.
