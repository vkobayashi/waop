This study explored the relationship between personal values, organizational values, and organizational commitment. Participants from a large petrochemical company rated 24 values with respect to how important the value was to them and how important it was to the organization. They also completed Meyer and Allen's commitment scale. The results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses found that commitment was predicted by the employeesâ€™ perception of organizational values. Furthermore, affective, normative and continuance commitment were each predicted by different clusters of values. This study highlights the importance of recognizing that values are multidimensional and that each value cluster may affect behaviour differently.
