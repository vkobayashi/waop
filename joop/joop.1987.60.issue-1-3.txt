Internal-external locus of control is an individual difference characteristic which, it has been proposed, affects the turnover process. Using a sample of 119 nurses, this longitudinal study found that locus of control moderated the relationships between two facets of satisfaction, promotion and pay, both to withdrawal cognitions and turnover. In addition, locus of control moderated the relationship between withdrawal cognitions and turnover. Internals showed significantly stronger negative relationships than externals between these satisfaction facets and withdrawal cognitions and turnover. Internals also showed a stronger positive relationship than externals between withdrawal cognitions and turnover. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for helping to understand employee turnover.
