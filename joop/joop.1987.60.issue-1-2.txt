In spite of the increased interest in the role of situational factors as moderators of leader orientation-performance relationships, the possible role of organizational transience as a mediating variable has been ignored. The authors used Fiedler's Least Preferred Co-worker (LPC) Scale in a study of 39 construction site managers. It was found that these managers have a stronger task orientation than other occupational groups who are typically located in relatively permanent organizations. The degree of transience of construction sites (i.e. the length of projects) moderated the LPC-performance relationship.
