Throughout the literature, there appears to be little support for the psychometric characteristics of scales measuring coping behaviour. This article explores the psychometric properties of the 20-item version of the Cybernetic Coping Scale (CCS; Edwards & Baglioni, 1993). Initially, confirmatory factor analysis and internal reliability analysis were conducted on large samples of data from four different studies in order to conduct an exhaustive examination of the scale. Results provided moderate support for the 20-item version of the CCS. However, improved model modification produced moderate to strong support for a 15-item version. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis was then conducted on the 15-item version of the CCS in order to cross-validate the measurement model across groups. Findings revealed a wellfitting model with a stable factor structure and partial measurement invariance. Both versions produced acceptable to high internal reliability. Findings indicate support for the use of the 15-item version of the CCS and suggest that this short version of the CCS is the best fitting model of all the other previously developed CCS scales.
