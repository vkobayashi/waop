Most entry-level training is directed to the enhancement of specific functional competences in a job. However, it is also important to seek to develop more general styles of effective working. This study distinguishes between intellectual and non-intellectual working styles, viewing the former primarily in terms of metacognitive processes and the latter as proactivity, social competence and self-confidence. A Working Styles Index is devised and refined, to permit measurement through judgements made by individuals and by their peers and supervisors. Evidence for internal and testâ€“retest reliability is provided, and validity is illustrated in relation to previously established instruments and ratings made by other people. Analyses of longitudinal data across a year within the national scheme of Youth Training reveal a significant increase in intellectual working style, which is predictable from personality-scale scores obtained at the outset of training. Applications of the Working Styles Index in processes of review and guidance within training are described.
