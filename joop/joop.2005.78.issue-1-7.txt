The primary aim of this study was to investigate the predictors of different organizational identification profiles. Hypotheses based on the social identity approach and the literature on organizational commitment were formed and tested in a sample gathered from employees of 20 shipyard subcontractors. The results supported the idea that different subgroup characteristics (prestige, contact, and size) may be used to explain four different combinations of subgroup identification (with the subcontractor) and superordinate identification (with the shipyard). However, contrary to our hypotheses, none of the variables concerning relationships between the subgroups (intergroup competition, intergroup contact and perceived discrimination) emerged as significant predictors.
