A random USA national sample of 300 psychotic and 300 psychoneurotic clients, with half the sample closed ‘rehabilitated’ and the other half closed ‘non-rehabilitated’, was investigated in connection with two time variables (months in rehabilitation process and training) and two cost variables (dollars for all services and facilities) in vocational rehabilitation process. As compared to psychotic clients, psychoneurotic clients tended to require more time in vocational rehabilitation process and training and less money for rehabilitation facilities. Rehabilitated clients were found to be in the vocational rehabilitation process for less time than non-rehabilitated clients. There were no appreciable differences between the psychotic and psychoneurotic groups on such outcome variables as work status at closure, occupational level at closure, and weekly earnings at closure. The findings suggest that different strategies are used to bring these clients differing in dysfunctional reactions to similar desirable outcomes.
