This study compares socialization experiences of 134 men and 84 women 8â€“10 months into their first jobs after college graduation. Generally the availability of various activities and events did not differ between men and women but men were more likely to report experiencing the various socialization activities as more helpful than were women. Contrary to speculations, the gender of an individual supervisor did not mediate either the perceived availability or helpfulness of various socialization opportunities. These findings are discussed within an attributional perspective.
