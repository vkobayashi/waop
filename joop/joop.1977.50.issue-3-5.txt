Some problems of investigating causal relationships when undertaking field research are outlined. The potential of cross-lagged correlation analysis in this context is assessed by describing the technique, its underlying assumptions and its previous use in applied occupational research. A method for evaluating the technique using simulated data is described. Preliminary findings using this approach show that cross-lagged correlation analysis is a viable technique under relatively straightforward conditions. Nevertheless, further work needs to be done before it is sufficiently well understood to give a high level of confidence in conclusions based on the technique.
