A role-play test was developed to assess the sales skills required for success in a telemarketing job. The 30-minute test was conducted entirely by telephone and consisted of four role-plays in which the ratee attempted to sell a service contract. In a concurrent validation study, the sum of two raters' independent evaluations of overall performance on the four role-plays was significantly correlated with both objective and subjective measures of sales performance. Based on generalizability analyses, the reliability of the overall ratings provided by two raters for four role-plays was .80 in the concurrent study and .76 when the role-play test was used operationally. This study demonstrated that ratings from a 30-minute telephone role-play test are valid and reliable predictors of sales performance.
