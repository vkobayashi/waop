The study is an application of Ghiselli's work on managerial talent to Hong Kong. Ghiselli's Self Description Inventory was administered to groups of managers, workers and engineers in Hong Kong and the results were compared with results obtained on similar groups in the USA. The results were broadly similar and indicate that Ghiselli's Self Description Inventory is potentially useful in cultures other than the USA. Specific differences between the results of the American and Hong Kong managers are discussed in terms of cultural variations.
