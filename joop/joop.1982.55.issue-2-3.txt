Schuler's (1980) role and expectancy perception model of participation in decision making was replicated and extended. While Schuler's previous study examined only participation in deciding how to do the work, this study also examined participation in setting work objectives within the role and expectancy perception framework. Partial support for Schuler's model was found and the extension of the model was supported.
