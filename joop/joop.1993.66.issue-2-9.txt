Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the factor structure of Meyer & Allen's (1984) commitment scales. Results supported a three-factor solution which included a bidimensional continuance commitment construct. Causal links between affective commitment and the two emergent dimensions of continuance commitment (personal sacrifices and low alternatives) were then studied with non-recursive models. Only one significant relationship emergedâ€”the sacrifice component of continuance commitment had a positive effect on affective commitment. This finding was interpreted from a self-justification perspective.
