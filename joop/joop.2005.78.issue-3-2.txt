This study represents a secondary analysis of existing data that were used in Spector and Jex's (1991) paper. The self-report and rater-report job-stress data were identical to those used in the study by Spector and Jex (1991). To gain a greater insight into the connections between the objective work environment and employees' job strains, this study added the job-stress data from a newly developed objective data source â€“ the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database. We found that an O*NET stressor was related to physical and behavioural strains. There is something in the objective environment that plays a role in employees' physical well-being and behaviour. Objectively measured stressors, however, were unrelated to psychological strains. Explanations were given to the lack of the relationship. Based on these findings, we suspect that there may be somewhat different factors at work for each type of strain.
