To find out how selection interviewers gather information, 101 candidates were intercepted immediately after initial graduate recruitment interviews, and questioned on the coverage of 26 topics. Interviewers were found to give more frequent coverage to topics concerned with future job and knowledge of company than present or past academic performance. The results were interpreted as indicating an interviewer preference for topic areas where he had an advantage over the candidate in terms of superior knowledge.
