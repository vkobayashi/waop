It is important to determine whether an assessment centre measures aptitude or merely certain characteristics of the participant, such as past experience at work and intelligence, which could be assessed by other less sophisticated means. This study investigated the performance of 81 middle managers whose potential for senior management was being assessed. Measures of overall potential and overall performance in the situational exercises were related to participants' previous experience (their functional specialism and specific work experience) and their seniority (grade), age, educational attainment and intelligence. Previous experience was not significantly related to overall performance and had a significant effect on performance in only one exercise. Intelligence was significantly related to overall performance and to performance in many of the exercises. Younger participants tended to be assessed as having greater potential, whilst managerial grade was not relevant. The main conclusions were that intelligence tests are useful for screening candidates and that past experience appears to have little effect on performance. The assessment centre appears to be evaluating managerial aptitude rather than previous experience.
