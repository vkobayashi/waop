In this study 646 children between the ages of 11 and 17 years of age were asked to state their vocational choices, preferences and aspirations. It was found that the children were able to distinguish between these categories. The pattern of the total number of occupations chosen in all three categories showed that, rather than the number being reduced as the children got older, there was an inverted U pattern with a gradual rise to age 13 and slight decrease to 16. The results also showed that males tend to list a greater range of choices, a slightly greater range of preferences and an almost similar range of aspirations to females. The implications of these results are discussed.
