From a public health perspective, physical activity is seen as important for disease prevention and psychological well-being. The purpose of the present study was to (a) examine the differences between members, those on the waiting list and non-members of a British corporate health and fitness club and (b) explore the differences between male and female employees on measures of mood states, physical well-being, job satisfaction and absenteeism. A total of 293 head office employees from a leading British food retail company agreed to take part in the study. The results tend to suggest that members of the club have better psychological mood states and physical well-being than non-members. Males were also physically healthier although there were no observed significant differences between males' and females' mood states. Analyses also indicated that members were more satisfied with their jobs and demonstrated fewer days absent from work than non-members. There were no recorded gender differences in levels of job satisfaction or absenteeism. These results are discussed with respect to the role workplace exercise clubs may have in facilitating job satisfaction, levels of absenteeism and physical and psychological well-being.
