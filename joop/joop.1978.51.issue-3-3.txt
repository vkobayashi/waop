This study examined the sources of job stress among 150 dentists. It was found that the ‘dentist at risk’ tends to be older, somewhat anxious, and feels he is perceived as an ‘inflictor of pain’, with pressures from his work stemming from trying to sustain and build a practice, too little work, administrative difficulties and having to cope with difficult patients.
