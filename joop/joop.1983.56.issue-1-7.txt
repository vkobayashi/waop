Four hundred and thirty-three managerial dyads were studied in order to test aspects of Graen's role-making model of leadership. Subordinates' negotiating latitude was found to be positively related to their job satisfaction and negatively related to their job problems, but to be uncorrelated with numbers of hours spent working. Leaders' negotiating latitude was not significantly associated with rated effectiveness of subordinates. Other predictions from the model were also unsupported. Conceptual and methodological suggestions for future research are offered.
