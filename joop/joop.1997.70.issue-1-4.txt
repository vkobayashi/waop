Despite having a good record as a predictor of job performance, biodata is seldom used for the selection of managers. Its infrequent use can be explained in part by noting that traditional biodata prediction models of job performance, developed in one context, do not readily transport into different ones. Organizations wishing to use biodata must first develop and validate such an instrument. As this is only feasible for large organizations, an alternative approach is to develop biodata instruments to predict specific attributes of a person. Such instruments will be more generalizable than those developed to predict a person's job performance.
This approach was tested by developing biodata models to predict vocational interest (as measured bv Holland's Self Directed Searchâ€”SDS) of a group of likely applicants for managerial jobs. Following factor analysis of the biodata, regression models were developed to predict individuals' scores on the six SDS scales. The models developed predict the criteria well. The findings indicate that biodata is a good predictor of vocational interest of individuals irrespective of their job or organization.
