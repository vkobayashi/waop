This article reports two studies that extend results of Motowidlo, Dunnette & Carter (1990) by providing further evidence about relations between situational inventory scores, job performance, and demographic factors. Study 1 found an average predictive validity of .25 against supervisory performance ratings in a sample of 36 management applicants from one telecommunications company. Study 2 found an average concurrent validity of .20, again against supervisory performance ratings, in a sample of 109 to 128 marketing incumbents from four telecommunications companies. Combined with results reported earlier, these results yield an overall validity estimate of .26, with race and sex differences estimated at less than a third of a standard deviation, and confirm the potential usefulness of the low-fidelity simulation in the form of a situational inventory for employee selection.
