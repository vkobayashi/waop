We examined fluctuations in the levels of work-family conflict (WFC), family-work conflict (FWC), and burnout during three different stages of international business trips among 66 business travellers. Participants completed questionnaires prior to the trip, during the stay abroad and after the trip. Analysis of variance detected differences in WFC, FWC, and burnout levels among the three stages of the trip, moderated by gender. The relationships of WFC and FWC with burnout were positive, whereas the direction of the relationship was reciprocal. This study advances the work-family interface theory and research by focusing on both between- and within-individual variations in work-family attitudes. Thus it captures the dynamic of this phenomenon.
