A source of bias in performance evaluations is a rater's inability to differentiate an individual's (subordinate's) performance from his or her work group's performance. This paper describes an approach for specifying and assessing individual versus work group effects in performance evaluations. Multiple indicators of self- and supervisor ratings of performance were examined in two field samples. Study results suggest that the self- and supervisor ratings of individuals' performances were not biased by work group membership and that individual effects were present.
