This study sought to investigate the characteristics of ‘nearby’ leaders by eliciting the constructs of male and female top, senior, and middle-level managers and professionals working in organizations in two large UK public sectors (local government and the National Health Service). An instrument, the Transformational Leadership Questionnaire (TLQ-LGV), was developed and piloted on a national sample of 1464 managers working for local government organizations. Analysis of the data, presented here, revealed the existence of nine highly robust scales with high reliabilities (a=.85) and with convergent validity (range r = .46 to .85). These findings are discussed, together with suggestions for subsequent research.
