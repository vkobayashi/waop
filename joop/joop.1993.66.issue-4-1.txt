Results from a two-year longitudinal field study supported the hypothesized positive relationship between mental health and subsequent work performance. Relative (retest correlational analysis) and absolute (change in mean level) stability analyses established mental health as a consistent and stable trait. The importance of dispositional (trait) explanations for organizational behaviours are discussed.
