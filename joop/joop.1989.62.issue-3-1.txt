Hunter & Hunter (1984) recently performed a meta-analysis on research on the interview for selection purposes and concluded its validity to be 0.14. The structured interview may be a promising alternative to the traditional unstructured interview. A review of structured interview studies is discussed and six additional validations are presented. A meta-analysis performed on structured interview validities resulted in an estimated validity of 0.39. Research implications are discussed.
