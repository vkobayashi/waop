Ratings of suitability for training as Naval Officer were obtained from each of four assessors both before and after the final consensus discussion of a selection assessment centre. Analysis was conducted of those cases where three assessors agreed on their initial rating. The probability of a shift after the discussion by the exception to the majority rating was related to (a) whether the exception's rating was initially above or below that of the majority; (b) whether or not the majority rating was high on the scale; (c) the Officer rank of the exception. There was also a significant interaction between (a) and (b) (above). These results are discussed in terms of group influences on decision making.
