This study investigated the relationships between role stress measures in the form of ambiguity, conflict, and overload and psychological strain (tension at work and job dissatisfaction) in a sample of 90 middle managers. Role stress was associated with low job satisfaction and high levels of tension at work, but these relationships were moderated by personality characteristics. Individuals with Type A personality showed stronger relationships between role ambiguity and psychological strain than those with Type B personality. Also, role ambiguity was significantly associated with high tension at work in individuals classified as externals on Rotter's Locus of Control scale, but not in those classified as internals. Individuals were classified as either tolerant of ambiguity or intolerant of ambiguity on the basis of their scores on Budner's Measure of Intolerance of Ambiguity. Role ambiguity was significantly associated with psychological strain in the latter group but not in the former.
