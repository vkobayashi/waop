A number of authors have proposed that self-assessment may represent a valid tool for use in assessment situations. Research suggests that those who are accurate in self-assessments of performance actually perform more effectively, e.g. in the job or at an assessment centre. This study examined the properties of two measures of self-assessment (absolute accuracy of self-assessment and degree of inaccuracy of self-assessment) in a graduate assessment centre. Results showed that an accurate self-rating of performance on one assessment centre exercise reliably distinguished between accepted and rejected candidates. Further, and importantly, this effect remained after variance attributable to psychometric tests and demographic variables had been controlled for. That is, some accurate self-assessments appear to have incremental validity above and beyond psychometric tests. However, the magnitude and direction of self-assessment inaccuracy was significantly different between the accepted and rejected candidates for three of the four exercises. These results suggested that while variables associated with self-assessment may impact on the size of the inaccuracy of self-assessments, the impact of such variables may not lead to accurate self-assessment.
