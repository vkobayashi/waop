Assessment centre evaluations of candidates were analysed for evidence of assessor-assessee sex effects. Results from this investigation revealed a significant main effect for assessee sex, favouring females over males, and a significant interaction effect between the sex composition of the assessor group and assessee sex. These results are compared with past empirical evidence and discussed in the light of current theory.
