The aim of the two studies was to confirm and clarify the relationships between values and components of organizational commitment (OC) in two organizations. Study 1 extended the work of Finegan (2000) by investigating antecedents of OC in terms of personal and perceived organizational values while controlling for the effects of tenure. Study 2 involved a field experiment to investigate the consequents of OC in terms of turnover intention, how such intention varies as a function of the values of the alternative employer, and how it is related to the different components of OC. The results of Study 1 provide support for the argument that perceived organizational values are drivers of values-based OC, but that unlike the related components of affective and normative OC, continuance OC may not be values-based. Study 2's results indicated that turnover intention was higher in a company supporting vision values, and that affective OC acted as a buffer against interest in alternative employment. Together these findings imply that companies adopting prosocial values, such as vision, self-direction, and humanity may enhance affective and normative OC, and thus performance.
