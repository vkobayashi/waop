Eight hundred randomly selected members of the Smaller Business Association of New England were mailed the Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS) and a biodata questionnaire. A total of 368 chief executive officers completed both instruments, representing a response rate of 46***.0 per cent. Based on the JAS, 82 per cent of the respondents were characterized by the Type A or coronary-prone behaviour pattern. Corporate performance was plotted against Type A and B scores. Firms run by Type As showed a higher return on investment and greater five-year growth in sales revenue than firms run by Type Bs, but this pattern was found only for the Job Involvement subscale.
