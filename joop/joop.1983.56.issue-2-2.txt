This article presents the findings of a case study which describes the impact of computerized controls on the jobs of biscuit-making operators. Examination of company documents and interviews with managers indicated that decisions to use this technology were influenced more by people within the organization than by external economic and market forces. The chairman's investment policy, and the management objective of improving control over production, were key factors. Interviews with operators indicated that different applications of computing technology had different effects on jobs. The use of computer-controlled dough mixing replaced the craft skills of the doughman. In contrast, the use of computerized biscuit packet weighing complemented the skills and knowledge of the ovensman by giving him more information on production performance, and requiring him to exercise judgement and discretion to control the process. The effects of technical change on work organization depend on a combination of factors, including the capabilities of the equipment, management objectives, and the physical and organizational structures created by past decisions. Human operators may retain key roles in computerized systems. It is therefore important that work is organized to develop the human skills and motivation required for overall system effectiveness.
