The purpose of the present study among 114 maternity nurses was to determine whether perceived equity in the employeeâ€“employer exchange relationship is related to informational support from the organization and whether self-efficacy beliefs play a role in this relationship. The results show that nurses with weak self-efficacy beliefs were apparently sensitive to the degree of informational support. In contrast, nurses with strong self-efficacy beliefs felt equitably treated by the organization for which they worked even when they felt that they received relatively little informational support. In line with earlier studies, the findings indicate that perceptions of inequity are accompanied by burnout symptoms.
