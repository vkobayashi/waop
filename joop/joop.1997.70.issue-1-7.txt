To examine the notion that cyclic dysfunction among female employees is a pervasive workplace problem, 438 employees completed a survey of the past week's stress, health and work experiences. A 4 (menstrual cycle status) X 2 (occupational level) analysis showed no differences between groups of perimenstrual women, postmenstrual women, non-menstruating women, and male colleagues on dimensions of illness, wellness, work performance, absenteeism, or subjective stress; although there were occupational differences in stress, health and work impairment. Women with perceived premenstrual syndrome (PMS) showed no evidence of perimenstrual dysfunction. This group consistently reported high stress, poor health, and work impairment across the menstrual cycle. Employers need not fear cyclic decrements in female employees' productivity; however, self-diagnosed PMS appears to be linked with persistent health and work problems.
