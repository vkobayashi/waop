Twenty-three professional persons were interviewed extensively to find out how they keep their appointment calendars and to extract from that information suggestions about how calendars could be computerized. For the majority of the persons interviewed calendars are indispensable to the conduct of their business, and, in some cases, their personal lives. At the same time the data show an unexpectedly large amount of diversity in the kinds of calendars people use and in the ways they use them. Substantially more than half of the respondents have more than one calendar, with two persons using as many as six calendars at once. Portability and access from diverse locations are important for many persons. Concerns about privacy vary widely: some persons keep their calendars closely guarded, others allow free access to them. Relevant time spans covered by calendars are enormous. Some few people are concerned only with the current day and the day following, others may plan appointments a year or more in advance. A substantial number of appointments are changed after they have been made and, once again, the range is large, from about 2 per cent for some persons to about 80 per cent for others. Archiving, query patterns, and the insertion of correlated information into calendars also vary greatly among various users.
