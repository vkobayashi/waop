There is a controversy in the literature over which theory of the job-life satisfaction relationship (spillover, compensation or segmentation) is correct. We argue in the present study that each model is possible for different individuals. Using techniques derived from Ghiselli (1960), the results suggested that while the relationship is positive for most individuals, it is not for all. Contributions of the findings and future research directions are discussed.
