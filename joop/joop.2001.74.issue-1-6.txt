This study shows that, when occupational complexity is controlled for, intelligence has a significant positive effect on Incumbent Perception of Job Complexity (IPJC), in contrast to the negative effect it has on job satisfaction. This result is interpreted to imply that a significant portion of the within-occupation variance in IPJC reflects true variance in job complexity. Implications for the measurement of job complexity and for the processes that determine job complexity are discussed.
