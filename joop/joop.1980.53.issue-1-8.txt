The orthodox approach to selection validation has remained unchallenged and unaltered for over half a century. Its continued acceptance, reinforced by the misleading claims of many test constructors, leads to the likelihood that selection will become routine and mechanical in operation.
The author examines evidence from his own research, based on nine companies and over 3000 entrants to work, which suggests that this danger is a real one. Reference is made to recent evidence that validation studies are rarely conducted, and several practical reasons are given for this. However, the situation cannot remain unchanged. In the United Kindgom, the Sex Discrimination Act (1975) and the Race Relations Act (1976) demand the use of valid and job-related predictors. It is argued that such legislation should be welcomed since it will encourage the development of more healthy approaches to selection and to greater understanding of the psychological demands of jobs.
