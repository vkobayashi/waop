This study investigated the computerization of the Weighted Application Form (WAF). A discriminant analysis was performed on the application form responses of 281 nursing course applicants. Computer software was then developed incorporating the classification function from the discriminant analysis procedure. In the second part of the study 45 subjects were divided into three groups and entered eight sets of nursing course application form data. The ‘computerized’ group received instructions on how to do this from the screen, the ‘written’ group from a manual and the ‘verbal’ group verbally from the experimenter. Time taken to complete the task and the number of errors made were recorded. Results indicated that group influenced time taken on the task and that group did not exert an influence on errors made on each question. As a result of the experimental work and responses to a questionnaire, it was concluded that the ‘computerized’ version of the software was the option that should be adopted for computer software involving the WAF.
