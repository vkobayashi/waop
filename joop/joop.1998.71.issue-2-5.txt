This study examined relationships between caring responsibilities and the levels of perceived pressure experienced by working women and whether marital status and employment status impacted upon the perception of pressure. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire which was issued to 821 female university employees; a 45 per cent response rate was achieved. Results showed that caring responsibilities correlated positively with the amount of pressure reported by working women; marital status affects the perception of pressure in that married women reported that they felt under more pressure than single women; and part-time workers felt themselves to be under more pressure than their full-time colleagues.
