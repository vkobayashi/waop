The study examines whether an affective response influences the dimensionality of a perceptual measure of task characteristics, the Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS). It was hypothesized that affective response to the job may operate as a source of bias and influence the dimensionality of the instrument. Non-supervisory employees in two separate organizations completed the 15-item task characteristics section of the JDS. A factor analysis of the responses resulted in a unique solution for each organization. An affective response (intrinsic job satisfaction) was then partialled out of the inter-correlations of the 15 JDS items and a second factor analysis was performed on the residual data. The results indicated that removing an affective response improved the dimensionality of the instrument.
