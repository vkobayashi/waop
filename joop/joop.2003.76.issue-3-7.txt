Previous research has focused on influences of coping on emotional and behavioural outcomes. Less is known about why people cope in the way they do. Drawing on an appraisal theory of emotion, it was expected that secondary appraisal components would be related to coping. Information on appraisal components, emotions, and coping in relation to a recent work stressor was provided by 107 female nurses. Appraisals were associated with coping in theoretically interpretable ways (e.g. active coping and behavioural disengagement with optimistic and pessimistic appraisals of problem-focused coping potential, respectively). The study highlighted emotion theory as useful for exploring possible coping antecedents in a conceptually integrated way.
