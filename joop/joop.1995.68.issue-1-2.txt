Two studies assessed the hypothesis that heightened variability in the presentation of job candidate profiles would lead raters to judge ratees as less stable and suitable, and to feel less confident in their decision. In a simulation of recruitment for bank tellers, corporate employees were given 12 graphic profiles of candidate performance on 12 characteristics, and asked to rate candidate stability and suitability, along with feelings of confidence. Profiles reflected differing mean standings as well as degrees of between-trait variability. In Study 1 (N = 128), it was found that variability influenced only the evaluation of stability. In Study 2 (N = 126), trait labels were removed from the profiles. Here, results indicated that variability influenced stability, suitability and confidence ratings. Discussion focused on implications of decision making in situations of inconsistency.
