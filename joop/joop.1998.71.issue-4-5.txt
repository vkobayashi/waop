This paper reports the findings of a study comparing the methods used to select university graduates in British, Dutch and French organizations. In keeping with several recently published studies of managerial selection practices, a number of highly significant differences were observed in terms of the use of various selection methods across the three countries. The paper concludes with a call for follow-up studies of an in-depth, qualitative nature, in order to uncover the reasons for the existence of these cross-national variations in patterns of usage.
