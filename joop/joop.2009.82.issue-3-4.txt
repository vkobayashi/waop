The present study investigated differential relationships, nonlinear relationships, and multiplicative relationships among the subdimensions of extraversion (agency and affiliation) and job performance (getting ahead and getting along) for a sample of 179 managers. We found that: (i) agency was positively related to getting ahead performance, whereas affiliation was unrelated to getting ahead; (ii) agency had an inverted-U relationship with getting along performance; and (iii) there was a multiplicative effect of agency and affiliation on getting along. The findings provide insight into the nature of the relationship between extraversion and managerial performance, the level of breadth at which to represent these variables for optimal prediction and explanation, and the use of extraversion measures for selection purposes.
