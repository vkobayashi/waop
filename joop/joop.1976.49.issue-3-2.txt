The accumulated research, while contributing substantially to our understanding of complex leadership processes, has not yet produced an integrated body of knowledge. Still plagued by definitional ambiguity, a proliferation of terms, and contradictory research findings, the mountain of evidence has left many unanswered questions.
Traditional approaches to leadership have focused primarily on the relationship between the leader and the group. Studies of what managers actually do—as opposed to what they should, could, or say they do—suggest that the leader–system relationship may be a more fruitful focus. The nature of managerial work, as reflected by observed behaviour, can be a valuable guide for designing future leadership research and training.
