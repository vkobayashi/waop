Adopting the social identity perspective on organizational identification proposed by Ashforth and Mael (1989), the present study tested two hypotheses concerning the importance of work-group identification (WID) relative to organizational identification (OID). WID was predicted to be stronger than OID as well as more predictive of organizational attitudes and behaviour. Data about employeesâ€™ WID, OID, job satisfaction, turnover intentions, job involvement, and job motivation from two samples (N = 76 and N = 163) supported these predictions. We conclude that our understanding of organizational attitudes and behaviour has much to gain by an open eye for the multiple foci of identification that are associated with organizational membership, and that managerial practice may benefit from an increased focus on the work group.
