On the basis of previous research and unincorporated theories of attitude formation and learning, multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant analysis were used to identify differences in personal characteristics, perceptions and attitudes of union members and non-members in general, and by sex. The study used a natural field setting incorporating the unusual characteristics of: (a) substantial proportions of women, (b) complete volition in the membership decision, and (c) control of non-random confounding variables across employment settings. The study therefore addressed particular limitations of previous studies in this area. Results indicate that differences exist, in accordance with relevant theory, between voluntary members and non-members, and potentially important sex differences exist within these groups as well.
