This study sought to test the disaggregation hypothesis of the relationship between life satisfaction and job satisfaction (Rice, Near & Hunt, 1980) which proposes that the relationship is stronger for individuals who value work in their lives. To date, tests of the hypothesis have been inadequate due to insufficient measures of work value and life satisfaction. This study found support for the hypothesis using improved measures and a more appropriate analytic technique. Principal component regression was the appropriate technique to detect a moderating effect in data with linear dependencies.
