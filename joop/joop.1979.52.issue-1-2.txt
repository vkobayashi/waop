The relationships between age and diversity of interests in general, and in job-specific occupational areas on the one hand, and salary treatment (as a measure of performance) and intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction on the other hand, were investigated for 291 scientists and engineers. Results for young and old but not intermediate-age subjects indicated that high diversity of interests in general occupational areas, as measured by the Strong Vocational Interest Blank, was related to a salary-based measure of performance. Diversity of interests in general and in job-specific occupational areas was linearly and positively related to intrinsic satisfaction. Age demonstrated a significant positive relationship to extrinsic satisfaction.
