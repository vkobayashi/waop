A field study was conducted with 175 Civil Service clerical employees. The results indicated that extraverts preferred jobs with higher levels of cognitive task demands, pace of task demands, cognitive closure, extrinsic rewards and intrinsic rewards. Neuroticism was negatively related to these preferences except for extrinsic rewards, and the relationships were not as strong. Extraverts were found to be less satisfied than introverts with their present clerical job in terms of the work itself, supervision and co-workers as measured by the Job Descriptive Index. Neuroticism was unrelated to job satisfaction.
