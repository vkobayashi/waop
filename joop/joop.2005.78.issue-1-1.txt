Research has shown that organizational subunits where employee perceptions are favourable enjoy superior business performance. The service profit chain model of business performance (Heskett, Sasser, & Schlesinger, 1997) has identified customer satisfaction as a critical intervening variable in this relationship. This paper examines the relationships between organizational climate, employee attitudes, customer satisfaction, and sales performance in the retail-banking sector. The role of customer satisfaction as a mediator between employee attitudes and sales performance is examined in a large sample of bank branches, spanning multiple organizations. Mediation effects are found, which border on significance when the sample size is large, but the effects seem to be too small to be of practical importance. It is argued that alternative formulations of the service profit chain model may provide more powerful explanations of the link between employee attitudes and business performance.
