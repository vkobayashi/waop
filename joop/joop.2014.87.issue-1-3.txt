This commentary argues that the quality and usefulness of student-recruited data can be evaluated by examining the external validity and generalization issues related to this sampling method. Therefore, we discuss how the sampling methods of student- and non-student-recruited samples can enhance or diminish external validity and generalization. Next, we present the advantages of the student-recruited sampling method (heterogeneity of the sample, student learning, cost reduction, and elaborate research designs) and conclude with making additional suggestions on how to improve the quality of these data.
