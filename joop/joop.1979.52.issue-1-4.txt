The study focused on the motivational determinants of ratings' willingness to enrol in a retraining course for commissioned rank. The utility of the VIE theory of motivation was tested by examining the independent contribution of SVI, E and SVI Ã—E to explained variance in the criterion. Data were collected by means of individual structured interviews. Using analysis of variance the results indicated that E was the only predictor from the motivational model.
