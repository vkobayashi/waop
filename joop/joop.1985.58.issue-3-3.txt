This study investigated the effects of normative social influence and group cohesiveness on job incumbents' perceptions of their jobs and satisfaction with various facets of their work. The argument developed was that the intensity or approval attached to a norm-regulated behaviour (Jackson, 1966, 1975) and the cohesiveness which characterized one's attachment to a work group would have social information processing (SIP) effects analogous to saliency and consistency as proposed by Salancik & Pfeffer (1978). Results, using data collected from 79 subjects holding the same job in 21 work groups, showed both direct and interactive effects of normative influence and cohesiveness on perceptions and satisfaction. These findings are interpreted as consistent with an SIP view of jobs and extend previous studies that have focused solely on the effects of informational social influence.
