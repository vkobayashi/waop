This study examined the utility of self-rating compared to supervisory and management ratings of training needs. Both self- and supervisory assessment of training needs were collected from 200 managers and professionals using a discrepancy model of needs assessment. Self-ratings tended to be more lenient and evidenced less halo than supervisor ratings of subordinates. Self- and supervisory needs assessment of the subordinate were not significantly related. Self-ratings of needs assessment resulted in three independent factors while supervisory needs assessment of subordinates resulted in only one general factor. These findings, coupled with evidence that supervisors projected their own needs when identifying subordinates' needs, suggested that self-ratings of needs assessment may be an important component of a valid needs assessment process.
