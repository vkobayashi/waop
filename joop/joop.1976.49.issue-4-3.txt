Interviewers engaged in graduate recruitment were asked to rate the importance of 12 characteristics which applicants might possess. Factor analysis of the responses produced four main factors. These were labelled ‘achievement motivation’, ‘well informed about the job and company’, ‘quality of references’, and ‘academic performance’. When personnel managers were compared with non-personnel managers, the former placed greater emphasis on both achievement motivation and being informed about the job applied for, but attached less importance to academic performance. The results are discussed in terms of possible differences in the work-related values of these two groups of managers.
