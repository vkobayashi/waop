Measured mental and physical abilities of incumbents in selected US Navy jobs were compared with job requirements predicted using the Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ). A significant and meaningful pattern of correlations was found between commercially available PAQ attribute predictions derived from 25 Navy jobs and mental abilities measured using the Armed Forces Vocational Aptitude Battery. Additionally, significant relationships were found between physical strength requirements of 26 Navy jobs and PAQ-based predictions of job requirements. The results support use of the PAQ to establish differences of ability requirements among jobs. Specific applications are discussed, including use of the PAQ in research on environmental stress, derivation of the manpower requirements for equipment systems and personnel placement.
