The performance of 10 experienced and 10 inexperienced pilots was compared under normal and reversed control stick conditions. Using the T-11 (F-80) flight simulator, the pilots ‘flew’ a tracking mission under the normal stick condition, and then with the control stick polarity reversed. Performance was good for both groups under the normal condition, although the experienced pilots were notably more accurate for altitude control. Under the reversed control condition both groups performed poorly. However, the experienced pilots' mean tracking error was four times greater than the inexperienced group's for altitude and two times greater for heading. The results were interpreted as further supporting the design principle of not violating occupational stereotypes, and as demonstrating the problems of cross-training experienced operators to different control systems.
