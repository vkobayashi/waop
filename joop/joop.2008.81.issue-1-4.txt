We analysed whether relationship conflict mediates the link between task conflict and shared affect at the team level of analysis. Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that the relationship between these two types of intra-team conflict would be moderated by team members' interaction. The sample was composed of 156 bank branches. Data were gathered at two points in time. Two affect dimensions (tension and enthusiasm) were measured. The results obtained supported our hypotheses. Relationship conflict fully mediated the relationship between task conflict and team affect. Team members' interaction about team issues moderated the relationship between task conflict and relationship conflict, so that when team members' interaction was low, the relationship enhanced, whereas when team members' interaction was high, the relationship weakened.
