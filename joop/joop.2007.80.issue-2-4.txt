Based on the goal orientation model of feedback-seeking behaviour, goal orientations are proposed to influence employees in the type of information they seek from knowledgeable others in the work environment. As hypothesized, a survey conducted among 170 medical residents of a Dutch university hospital showed that a learning-approach goal orientation had a positive relationship with the seeking of self-improvement information and a negative relationship with the seeking of self-validation information. In contrast, a performance-approach goal orientation was negatively related to the seeking of self-improvement information, while a performance-avoidance goal orientation was positively related to the seeking of self-validation information. Unexpectedly, a performance-avoidance goal orientation was also found to be positively related to the seeking of self-improvement information.
