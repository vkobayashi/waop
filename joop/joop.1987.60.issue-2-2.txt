Almost 4000 principal wage-earners were surveyed to assess the main and interactive effects of undesirable and desirable life-events, social support, and perceived and objective job security on psychological symptoms. Events and support were measured for both the job and non-job spheres. Three methods of analysis were used. Ordinary regression was used as a preliminary analysis and to provide comparison with the customary approach. A second analysis was based on dichotomizing the continuous symptom variable at a point approximating a ‘case’ vs. non-case distinction. The third analysis used a small panel to control for time 1 symptoms. The different methods produced somewhat different results but, in general, provided support for certain main effects including desirable life-events and job security but little or weak support for the moderating effects of such variables as social support.
