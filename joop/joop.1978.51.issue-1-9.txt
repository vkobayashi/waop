Traditionally, careers guidance has been concerned with promoting occupational satisfactoriness rather than satisfaction. Today, more emphasis is placed upon the life of the individual than the characteristics of the occupation. With more variables being brought into play, career choice has become more difficult. Careers advisers are expected to be not only organizers and disseminators of information, but also counsellors in group and individual situations. The computer can help with the first in order to give more time for the second. The joint research project between the Education Department of Cheshire County Council and the IBM UK Scientific Centre ran from September 1973 until June 1974. Since then, further field trials have taken place, over two years of regular usage have occurred and further developments have been made to the original program. This paper describes the philosophy and development of the system, reports on the two field trials and gives recommendations for the use of the computer in the guidance process in schools.
