Using a sample of 211 working adults, an instigated workplace incivility measure, distinct from an experienced workplace incivility and general interpersonal deviance measures, was developed. Correlates of instigated workplace incivility were then tested using 162 medical technologists over a 4-year time frame. Results indicated that Time 1 measures of distributive justice and job satisfaction were negatively related to instigated workplace incivility, while a Time 1 measure of work exhaustion was positively related to such incivility. Furthermore, these three antecedents contributed significantly to explaining instigated workplace incivility, beyond Time 2 measures of these three variables. Future research issues, as well as study limitations, are discussed.
