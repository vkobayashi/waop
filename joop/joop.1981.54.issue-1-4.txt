Two experiments investigated the effects of employers' brochures and selection interviews upon the intentions of students. It was found that some brochures increased the intentions of engineering students to apply to the organization they represented; and that interviews decreased students' intentions to accept jobs if offered them. These effects could not be attributed to changes in the mediating variables of decision theory. The effect of interviews, however, was related to the extent to which students' expectations of the interview were proved incorrect by their experience of it.
