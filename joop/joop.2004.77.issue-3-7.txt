The present study tested the factorial validity of the Maslach Burnout Inventory among 1590 human service workers. Confirmatory factor analyses of the total sample as well as multi-group analyses and analyses of each of seven professional groups separately, indicated that the original three-factor model of the MBI provided a reasonable fit to the data. However, a factorial model with items 12 and 16 removed provided a superior fit, with two of the fit indices over .90 and an RMSEA value of .06. The results of a multi-group analyses for the seven occupational groups showed a slightly poorer fit to the data than in the total sample. With a few exceptions, the fit indices of the models tested for each subsample separately indicated similar results, and the proposed 20-item model also provided the best fit for the subsamples. Internal consistencies of the subscales of the MBI were acceptable, and test-retest reliability indicated stability of scores over a 6-month interval. These results indicated that the proposed three-factor structure of the MBI based on 20 items can be replicated in the total sample as well as across occupations within human services in Norway.
