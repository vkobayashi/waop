This paper reports the findings of a study of the willingness to attend union meetings using the expectancy valence motivation framework of analysis at the individual level. A goal motive application of Klandermans' (1984a,b,c) model of union meeting attendance was tested on a sample of blue-collar union members using a range of attitudinal measures. The willingness to participate was found to be strongly related to both goal motives and role-related characteristics. The expectancy valence framework is shown to be relevant for procedural membership meetings. Pessimistic estimates of the likely participation of lay members was found to increase the importance for office holders of their own attendance.
