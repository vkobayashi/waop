The present study attempts to find out the differential effects of supervisory behaviour on morale of blue-collar workers (n = 200). The ‘Supervisor's Orientation Schedule’ was specially designed to determine employee-oriented and production-oriented styles of supervision. Morale was measured with the help of the ‘Employees’ Morale Scale' which includes four subscales (fairness of employer's policies and behaviour, adequacy of immediate leadership, sense of participation, and sense of worth of the organization). The results show that global morale scores as well as scores on the subscale of fairness of employer's policies and behaviour, adequacy of immediate leadership, and sense of participation are all significantly higher (a = 0·01) under employee-oriented supervision. The findings are suggested to have relevance to the economic growth and industrial wellbeing in the Third World.
