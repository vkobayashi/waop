This paper explores the role of personality, and the predictive validities of personal statements (PSs) and previous academic performance in relation to future performance in medical training. One hundred and seventy-six medical students had their application PSs coded into information categories and were followed over a 1-year period and assessed on (1) 21 different assessments (observations, exams, essays, etc.) and (2) the dimensions of the five-factor model (FFM) of personality. Neither the PS information categories nor the amount of information in PSs were found to be predictive of future performance. However, both previous academic performance (Betas .41 and .45) and conscientiousness (Betas .58 and .49), from the FFM, were related to success in medical training. Conscientiousness also demonstrated incremental validity over previous academic performance. Implications concerning the role of personality in medical selection are discussed in terms of trait complexes and trait facets.
