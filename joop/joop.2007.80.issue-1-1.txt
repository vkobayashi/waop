Data on the recent operation and content of the Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology (JOOP) are reviewed and conclusions drawn about the journal and the current state of the field. The benefits of contextualizing research and of strengthening the links between research and practice are discussed. Recommendations to authors, and new elements of JOOP policy and procedure, are outlined. These should be read alongside the earlier editorial statement (Arnold, 2004).
