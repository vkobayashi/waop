This study examined the structure of occupational well-being among 1,252 Dutch teachers. Building on Warr (1994) and Ryff (1989), a multidimensional model for occupational well-being (including affective, cognitive, professional, social and psychosomatic dimensions) was proposed and tested. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the distinction between these dimensions. A second-order factor analysis revealed that affect was the most central dimension, supporting earlier conceptualizations of subjective well-being that mainly focused on affect.
