A Hebrew version of the Brook Test was used as an unbiased, non-suggestive instrument to measure the difference in interests between boys and girls aged 14–18 (grade 9–12). The largest difference (one standard deviation) was in technical interest.
A group of 166 adults from four occupations was used to cross-check the results. In this group the interests related much more to the subjects' occupations than to their sex.
