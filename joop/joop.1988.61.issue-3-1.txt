In this study, the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire and self-report measures of work experiences were completed by newly hired university graduates 1, 6 and 11 months after starting employment. The time-lagged influence of work experiences on commitment, and of commitment on work experiences, was examined using structural regression analyses. The results revealed effects of work experiences in the first month of employment on commitment measured after 6 and 11 months. The strongest and most consistent effects were obtained for confirmation of pre-entry expectations and the opportunity for self-expression. Some, albeit weaker, evidence was also provided for time-lagged effects of commitment on perceived work experiences, particularly in the 6â€“11-month lag. Implications for theory and research concerning the development of commitment are discussed.
