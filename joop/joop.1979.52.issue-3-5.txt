A Leisure Checklist (LC), consisting of 36 items keyed to Holland's six vocational categories, was completed by 907 Year 10 students. Correlations between LC scores and nominated spare time activities supported the LC's validity. Consistent correlations were found among respondents' LC scores and the Holland categories of their inventoried vocational interests (VP1) expressed vocational interests (Future Possibilities), and school subject preferences. These associations among educational, vocational, and avocational choices suggest that Holland's categories, and possibly the LC, could be useful in future research on the relationship between work and leisure.
