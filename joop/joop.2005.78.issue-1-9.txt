Using data from 467 members of a large firm in the United States, this paper found that perceived work-group support is a distinct construct from perceived organizational support. To reinforce the uniqueness of the constructs, the work-group and organizational support constructs exhibited meaningful, differential relationships with six of eight variables reflecting different levels of exchange relationships and commitments. The implications of these findings are discussed.
