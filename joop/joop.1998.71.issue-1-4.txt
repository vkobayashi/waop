The health consequences of occupational stress among male and female bus drivers were studied in an 18-month longitudinal study. Changes in workload appeared to influence spillover of fatigue from work to leisure, perceived effort at work, and psychosomatic symptoms at Time 2, controlling for outcome measures 18 months previously. The potentially stress-related intake of drugs was not affected by change in workload. No gender differences or any interactions between gender and occupational stressors were found. Statistical controls for negative affectivity did not alter any of these results. The importance of studying occupational stress and health among men and women who perform the same tasks at work is discussed.
