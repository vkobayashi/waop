This research tests longitudinal data from a two-year period for differences in absenteeism rates for different shifts. The data support the importance of analysing temporal trends for the dependent variable of absenteeism. They also support interactions between shift and temporal trends even though no main effect differences were found between shifts. Qualifications of the meaning of shift as an independent variable must be made in future absenteeism research.
