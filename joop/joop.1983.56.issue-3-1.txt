Relationships between proportions of voluntary union members present and measures of productivity and efficiency were examined among 12 functionally comparable human service organizations in the USA. Measures of productivity were unrelated to variations in voluntary union membership among the organizations. Proportions of union members appeared to be strongly and negatively associated with measures of efficiency, independently of organization size. However, management prerogative appeared to have an important influence on these latter relationships.
