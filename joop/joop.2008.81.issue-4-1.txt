This study investigated the effect of coaching interviewees on subsequent interview performance within a structured experience-based interview format. Using a post-test only experimental design, participants (N=144) were assigned to one of three coaching conditions of increasing comprehensiveness: low (introduction-only training), medium (introduction plus awareness training), and high (introduction plus awareness plus skill training). Results indicated that individuals who participated in more comprehensive coaching ultimately received higher interview ratings. Results also identified interviewee knowledge as a partial mediator of the relationship between coaching comprehensiveness and subsequent interview performance.
