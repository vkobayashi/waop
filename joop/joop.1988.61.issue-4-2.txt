A performance appraisal procedure called rated ranking is described in which alternation rankings are followed by a rating of the individuals ranked within the limits imposed by the initial rank orders. This procedure was used by 21 foremen in evaluating 185 semi-skilled mine and plant employees of a single company. The results of this application were used to investigate the value of the rated ranking procedure including reliability, nature of the distributions, differences between groups and individuals, halo, construct validity and potential bias in the evaluations. The results provide an encouraging picture of ranking procedures when the rated ranking process is incorporated. The approach has demonstrated value for the purpose of validating selection procedures.
