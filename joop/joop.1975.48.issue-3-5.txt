Starting from a view of the present, in which there is growing awareness of the socio-technical nature of work systems, the paper stresses the need to explore other levels of system in order to add to existing pictures of the world of work. Three aspects are considered: the interdependence between work and non-work, the entering and leaving process with its attendant transitional systems, and the wider societal and global reassessments of values and relationships. It is suggested that awareness of these and other aspects will lead to different concepts of work.
