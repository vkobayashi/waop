Functional job analysis was used to write 25 task statements. Inter-rater reliability of judgements concerning aptitude requirements of these tasks was assessed both correlationally and in terms of absolute agreement. Since judgements like these are made in most content validation research, it is critical that they at least be reliable. Analyses indicate that, in terms of both correlations and percent agreement, the ratings using functional job analysis scales were highly reliable.
