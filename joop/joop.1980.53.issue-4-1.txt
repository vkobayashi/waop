Existing job attitude measures are least appropriate in research concerning employed mothers with dependent children. Three scales are introduced which cover the mother's attitude to both her employment and domestic work roles, and the strain which may be generated by their interaction. Data from 185 working-class mothers are reported and associations with employment status, positive and negative affect, life satisfaction and social supports are described. Evidence is presented about the scales' internal consistency and validity, and it is concluded that they are suitable for use with this important and sizeable group of workers. The items are published in full.
