The present study is a cross-cultural investigation of the determinants of occupational affect. Data used were from Osgood et al.'s (1975) occupational category in the Atlas of Affective Meaning. Cross-culturally common concepts were rated on functionally equivalent semantic differential scales by high school students in 30 cultures. Using the Tzeng-Osgood (1976) model for validating componential analyses, standardized ratings of 24 occupational concepts on three affective dimensions (Evaluation, Potency, and Activity) were predicted from cross-cultural denotative components. Results indicated that, for almost all cultures, Skill and Morality components were the most important determinants of occupational affect and Sex displayed high variability. Comparisons of data from black and white American samples are also discussed.
