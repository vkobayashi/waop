This paper describes a method for producing a job classification scheme which was developed on a group of senior jobs in the UK Civil Service. Data about Activities and Knowledge required in a sample of the jobs were collected by means of a structured questionnaire. Factor and cluster analyses of these data were used to devise the scheme. The results were presented to the 524 incumbents who had completed questionnaires and an overwhelming majority regarded the resultant scheme as accurate and sensible. A second follow-up study allowed assignment techniques to be developed and provided a cross-validation of the results. The method used and potential uses of such schemes are discussed.
