In this paper, I suggest that counterproductive behaviour in the workplace has ripple effects throughout the service environment. Specifically, it was hypothesized that co-workers' organizationally and interpersonally directed counterproductive behaviour will have a negative, indirect association with focal employees' service performance, through the mediation of psychological perceptions of climate for service. Survey data were collected from 293 employees and their corresponding managers working at a fast-food restaurant chain, consisting of 16 stores. Structural equation modelling results supported the hypothesized relationships.
