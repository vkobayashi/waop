In the course of validating, for selection purposes, a trainability test for industrial sewing machinists, incidental evidence came to light which suggested that job applicants might be able to make much the same inference about their suitability for a particular job as might personnel selectors. The rate at which individuals reported for work, all having been offered the job, was positively and consistently related to their suitability for training as assessed by the trainability test. The data relate to over 1000 job applicants in some 50 different factories. The data are interpreted as being compatible with a social and reflexive model of man, and the authors advocate that the potential usage of self-appraisal devices within selection contexts be more fully explored.
