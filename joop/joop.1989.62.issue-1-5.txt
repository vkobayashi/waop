In a predictive study of qualified nursing staff in long-stay settings, ‘burnout’ variables, role ambiguity and perceived support from their superior were assessed. Absence through sickness and job turnover were then measured over the subsequent two years. Ambiguity about authority predicted frequency of short absences in the subsequent 12 months. Perceived lack of support and emotional exhaustion predicted the frequency of absences of more than four days, and more than seven days, respectively, in the subsequent 12 months. Feelings of depersonalization were correlated with departure from the job during the subsequent two years. Hypotheses are offered to draw together these particular findings, emphasizing the mediating role which feelings of ‘professional depression’ may play.
