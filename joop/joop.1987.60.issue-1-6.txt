This study examines the relationship between selected variables and the psychological health of strikers. The findings indicate that higher levels of savings, of non-work activity, and of social support, and favourable attitudes toward the union positively affect the psychological health of strikers. However, increases in the expected duration of the strike adversely affect the strikers' psychological health.
