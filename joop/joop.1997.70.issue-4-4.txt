This study reports the responses of 286 nursing staff of a large Malaysian hospital. Using a path-analytic approach it was shown that perceived information cues substantially contributed to job satisfaction, but the content task attributes were non-significant determinants of affective responses. Path analysis also revealed that the task content properties of identity, significance and autonomy as well as the interpersonal task attribute of dealing with others were significant contributors of organization commitment. An inference of regression analyses is that cultural relativity is a central element of the task environment. Implications, from these findings, for the Malaysian health care system and multicultural work settings, in general, are discussed.
