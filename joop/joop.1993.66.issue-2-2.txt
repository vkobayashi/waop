Managers (N = 753) responded to a questionnaire regarding their current managerial level, salary and subjective timetable. For the younger managers (CA = 23–34, N = 309), mobility predicted level and salary, but not for the middle (CA = 35–44, N = 309) or older (CA = 45 +, N = 135) groups. For younger and older managers, higher levels and salaries were to be found in smaller organizations. Amongst younger managers, women were paid lower salaries, while amongst the middle age group, men attained a higher level. These findings were taken to support a structurally determined tournament model of careers. Managers' subjective timetables were found to be related to their mobility, so that those who moved jobs more often perceived themselves to be more ahead. This finding occurred in both middle and older age groups, despite there being no objective evidence for such a relationship. This was explained in terms of subjective timetables being drawn from earlier and now irrelevant experience.
