Employment-related values were recorded at two levels of scope: perceived importance of the work-role and of particular job characteristics. Associations with workers' sex, age, employment status, and education level were significant. Work values also differed among countries with a different cultural heritage â€“ historically catholic, historically communist, or historically protestant. Implications for research into job content and reactions and for evaluative judgments in the operation of traits, motives, and attitudes were considered.
