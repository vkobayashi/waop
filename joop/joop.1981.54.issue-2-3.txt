In order to provide an understanding of the contribution made by the design of hospital wards to the well-being of nurses at work a model is proposed for the structure of ward evaluations. Use is made of facet theory to generate the model. A questionnaire is developed on the basis of the model by combining elements of the facets to create the questions. The model also predicts a pattern of correlations between questionnaire items on the basis of the facet elements of which they are composed. The predicted structure contains a facet concerning levels of interaction, which is axial to two further facets. One of these, dealing with the objects of the nurses' interaction, plays a polarizing role, being modulated by the third facet which concerns whether the object being interacted with provides patient care and comfort directly or indirectly. Taken together the three facets provide the hypothesis of a cylindrex for nurses' evaluations.
Clear empirical evidence for the cylindrex is provided as a result of a three-dimensional smallest space analysis carried out on the responses given by 1921 nurses in 144 wards in 23 hospitals throughout England, to a 93 item questionnaire developed as the result of a series of three pilot questionnaires. The implications of the cylindrex for future research and the development of design proposals are discussed.
