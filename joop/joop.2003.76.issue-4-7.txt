The Team Role Self Perception Inventory (TRSPI) has attracted several studies critical of its psychometric properties. This research uses a large data set and employs confirmatory factor analysis on within-scale scores to examine the dimensionality and reliability of the TRSPI's scales. Data show that five of the nine scales are unidimensional and that two other scales show generally good fit to a unidimensional solution. The ‘completer-finisher’ and ‘implementer’ scales show a better fit to a bidimensional structure and would benefit from improved item wording for a small number of items. The ‘shaper’ scale would also benefit from some attention to item wording. Reliability estimates suggest that the reliability of the TRSPI's scales is better than previous estimates imply.
