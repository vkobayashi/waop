A meta-analysis was conducted to test the moderating effect of higher-order need strength on the relationship between job scope and employee outcomes. Twenty samples were combined empirically using a modification of the Schmidt-Hunter procedure. Results provided some evidence of the hypothesized moderator effect for job satisfaction, motivation and performance, with the evidence for job satisfaction being strongest. Employees high on higher-order need strength demonstrated stronger correlations with all employee outcomes than employees low in need strength.
