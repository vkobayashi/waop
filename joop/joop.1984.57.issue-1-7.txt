A trial was made of a brief short-listing procedure, the aim of which was to identify applicants who were unlikely to be successful at a military assessment centre and whose attendance might therefore not be cost effective. Assessments of overall suitability, based on short interviews at a number of locations, correlated 0***.45 (n = 65) with assessment centre outcome. A subsequent headquarters reassessment, which included some further information, correlated 0***.53 with the outcome. It was found that variables relating to educational achievement, responsibility, and physical pursuits were particularly powerful in predicting the outcome, which is in agreement with known training demands. Problems involved in operating such a short-listing procedure are discussed.
