An increasing emphasis is being placed on more effective ways of identifying and developing future managers, administrators and executives. The in-tray (in-basket) exercise, which simulates or samples the typical contents of an executive's in-tray and is dealt with by assessees under standardized conditions, may have a significant contribution to make. The major research findings with the technique are reviewed in relation to the assumptions on which its utility depends. These concern face validity, content validity, concurrent and predictive validity, procedures for assessment of in-tray performance and the empirical determination of assessment criteria. Experimental data suggesting high relative face validity in graduate recruitment and adequate inter-rater reliability in senior executive promotion procedures are reported. Its utility in relation to the concept of achievement-versus-aptitude, to trainability testing and to equal opportunity at work is suggested, and avenues for future research are indicated. Finally a brief review is given of the extent of the use of the technique by organizations and its strengths, advantages and possible further applications.
