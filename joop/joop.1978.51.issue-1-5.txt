Seven computer systems have been developed in Britain to date to support careers guidance in schools. Their functions and features are compared, and an assessment is made of the relative merits of the computer as against alternative means of performing the same functions. There is also a discussion of the implitions of the computer for the role of the counsellor, and of the relative advantage of batch and interactive usage. Decisions about the use of computers should derive from, rather than be allowed to determine, the aims and objectives of guidance. Potentially, however, computers could play a significant part in sustaining the trend from a diagnostic-and-advisory approach to guidance work to a counselling-and-careers-education approach.
