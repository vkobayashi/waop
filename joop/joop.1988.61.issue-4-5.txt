Previous research has suggested that attendance at an Employment Rehabilitation Centre (ERC) leads to some favourable psychological outcomes, but little is known about which aspects of client experience at the ERC produce those outcomes. In this study, the psychological well-being and experiences of 38 clients at an English ERC were examined. Well-being improved significantly during the ERC course. Specific experiences associated with this improvement mostly concerned ERC work activity, ERC staff and ERC facilities rather than social relationships with other clients or clients' perceptions of their employment prospects.
