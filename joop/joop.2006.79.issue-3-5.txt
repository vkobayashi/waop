This article argues that the later work of Foucault, notably that set out in The History of Sexuality, can make a useful contribution to organizational and occupational psychology. It goes on to analyse accounts of stress, related by client-service workers during interviews, using concepts informed by this work. Such a method of analysing a key work experience takes us beyond the positivism that dominates the large stress literature. Our emphasis is on Foucault's ideas relating to the creation of oneself as a work of art and the moral problematization of pleasure, rather than the more commonly applied surveillance and disciplinary controls. We consider stress discourse in this light and note the often overlooked heterogeneity of these stress accounts and self-portraits. We note that creation of self may itself be a ‘stressful’ process. This use of Foucault allows a rich reading of stress discourses and could, the authors believe, be applied in other organizational and occupational research.
