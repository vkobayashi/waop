Plant relocation is an organizational change affecting not only the employees' working life, but also their non-working life. Most of the previous studies in the field focused on individual rather than plant relocation, and/or measured workers' initial relocation decision rather than their actual mobility. Based on role theory, the current study aimed to explore the impact of the roles of organization member, career holder, and family person, on the employee actual relocation. Prior to a relocation of an entire Israeli plant to a new site, we collected the responses of 91 employees. Afterwards, we tested whether the respondents actually relocated. Using discriminant analysis, the relative contributions of biographical and attitudinal variables associated with the above three roles to the discrimination between movers and non-movers were determined. The results show that as compared to the non-movers, movers were younger in age, had higher family support, and intended to remain longer in the organization. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.
