For a sample of 150 housekeeping and food service personnel employed in a large university hospital and their immediate superiors, several moderator candidates of the relationships between self and superior evaluations of job performance were assessed. Only tenure was found to moderate significantly (P =0Â·05) the relationship between self and superior ratings of one dimension of subordinate performance. The practical significance of the study's largely negative findings are discussed and a set of alternative explanations offered.
