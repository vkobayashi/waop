A short 14-item version of the Team Climate Inventory (TCI; Anderson & West, 1994) was developed and tested by using two Finnish samples of social and health care personnel (N = 1494 and N = 771). The results of LISREL and other analyses provided evidence of the four-factor structure of the short form, as well as of the internal homogeneity, reliability and normality of its scales across the two samples. Compared to the original TCI, an acceptable item coverage and predictive validity of the shortened version was demonstrated.
