The relationships between assessor and self-ratings of assessment centre dimensions were analysed. Participants were 167 candidates from an advanced management assessment programme. Assessor and self-ratings showed significantly different means and low correlations. Overall assessment ratings, cognitive ability and gender did not moderate these relationships. Furthermore, self-ratings were not strong predictors of overall assessment ratings. Despite the discrepancies between assessor and self-ratings, these ratings had very similar factor structures.
