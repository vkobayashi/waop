A relapse prevention (RP) module was added to a two-week training programme in order to evaluate its impact on post-training transfer. Locus of control, as well as the subjects' self-perceptions of the degree to which the work milieu would support their application of the skills taught, were also measured. The outcome (dependent) variables, measured for the 81 training participants, included reactions, knowledge and on-the-job skill usage, with the latter being obtained from both the trainees and their immediate supervisors. The results indicate that, as compared to appropriate controls, knowledge acquisition and the extent of strategy utilization was significantly higher for those who participated in the RP. Locus of control and perceived support interacted with the RP intervention on the extent of strategy utilization. The results are discussed in the light of previous research on the issue of transfer of training.
