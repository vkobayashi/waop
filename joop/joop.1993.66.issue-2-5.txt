This study examined the prediction of occupational stress, general life stress and mental health among 108 randomly sampled dentists who completed mail-survey questionnaires at two points in time. In multiple regression analyses, the outcome variables were the dentists' self-reported general life stress, dental practice-related stress and mental health. Predictors were locus of control, non-verbal expressiveness, age, gender, income, hours worked per year, social desirability response set, and baseline measures of occupational stress and satisfaction with 10 aspects of dental practice: staff; income; professional relations; professional time; delivery of care; patient relations; practice management; personal time; professional environment; and respect received as a dentist. Both dental practice-related stress and general life stress were predicted by baseline occupational stress, by feelings of lack of respect for practicing dentistry, and by dissatisfaction with the amount of professional time available to improve clinical skills. Poorer mental health was predicted by baseline occupational stress, by perceived lack of respect for practicing dentistry, and by feelings of having too little personal time.
