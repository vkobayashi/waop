Using a set of 20 validation studies involving the Occupational Personality Questionnaire (OPQ), the criterion-related validity of some personality variables was explored. Twelve criterion areas were developed and practitioners were asked to indicate their hypotheses about the predictive value of each personality scale for each criterion area. Meta-analysis techniques were then used to cumulate the results of the studies and to assess criterion-related validity. Three different meta-analysis procedures were used: (i) an average scale method, which estimated the average validity of the relevant scales for each criterion area; (ii) a composite scale method, which estimated the validity of a single composite personality variable constructed by combining the scores for the relevant scales in each criterion area; and (iii) an incremental method, which estimated the validity for personality scales after ability scores had been correlated with the criteria. On average the results showed mean sample size-weighted validity coefficients of around .20 for the personality variables, with higher values (up to .33) for criteria such as creativity, analysis and judgement; they also revealed very little overlap between the criterion variance correlated with ability and that associated with personality, with estimates of validity derived from the incremental meta-analysis similar in magnitude to those from the methods using personality alone.
