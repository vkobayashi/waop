Newspaper compositors, whose work has been redefined following the replacement of hot-metal technology by an electronic production process, have been surveyed and interviewed some three years after the change. Data were sought concerning their attitudes to their new task content, their reaction to the change in work methods and control, and their ideas about their future.

However, the majority have adjusted to the change and some prefer it.
