This study, for the first time, examines the relationship between pre-move relocation preparation with psychological well-being to job relocation. Psychological reactions of 54 relocators were measured before and after their move. The greater the reported pre-move relocation preparation the better was the relocators' post-move mental health and job-related contentment and enthusiasm. Furthermore, pre-move relocation preparation was associated with reduced problems during the move and this, in turn, resulted in better post-move adjustment.
