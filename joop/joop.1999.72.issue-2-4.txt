The criterion-related validity of a personality scale depends upon both logical and judgmental factors. Degree of logical implication between individual scales and criterion behaviours was assessed in terms of independently measured conceptual concordance, which was shown to be strongly associated with measured validity in a sample of managers. It is thus essential to control for conceptual concordance when examining other possible moderators of validity. In respect of judgmental moderators, behavioural criteria rated as more observable were found to yield significantly greater validity than less observable behaviours, and conceptual concordance and criterion observability were shown to interact to determine validity. Gender differences in judgments were also found: validity of a personality scale was significantly greater when criterion-ratings were provided by male managers of male subordinates than when male managers judged female subordinates. It is important to cite validity coefficients within specified boundary conditions, in respect of both conceptual concordance and judgmental attributes.
