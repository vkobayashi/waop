Warr's 1990 measures of job-related well-being and mental health are evaluated using data from a large sample (N = 3044) of white-collar employees within a large public service organization. Analyses based on age, gender and job characteristics produced similar findings to those reported by Warr. However, a confirmatory factor analysis failed to find support for the underlying model. Also, exploratory factor analysis pointed to some problems with the mental health scales. Recommendations for the improvement of the measures and modifications to the well-being model follow.
