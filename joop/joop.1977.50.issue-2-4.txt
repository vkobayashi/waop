An experimental training scheme, based on methods derived from the CRAMP system, was introduced for London Transport Underground guards. The existing training period and content were not altered. The objectives were to increase the pass rate and reduce the resignation rate of trainees during training, especially of both older men and those born overseas who are less likely to leave their jobs once they have passed the training period. Comparison of conventionally trained groups with experimental groups showed encouraging trends and the experimental scheme has now been adopted as the standard training programme by London Transport.
