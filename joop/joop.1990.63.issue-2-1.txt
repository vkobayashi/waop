A theoretical model is developed which looks at both performance evaluation and compensation decisions as feedback messages. Underlying and critical to the model is the role of causal attributions made by both the supervisor/source and recipient of feedback about the causes of the recipient's performance. Specific hypotheses are generated which account for discrepancies between supervisor and subordinate about these causes of performance. In addition, the presence and impact of external organizational constraints on feedback recipients' perceptions and performance are discussed.
