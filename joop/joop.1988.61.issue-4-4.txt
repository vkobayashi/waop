The development of the Work Locus of Control Scale (WLCS), a 16-item measure of generalized control beliefs in work settings, is described. Included is a discussion of item selection, norms, reliability and initial validation. Criterion-related validity is provided by correlations with other theoretically meaningful variables from six samples. The WLCS was found to correlate significantly with job satisfaction, intention of quitting, perceived influence at work, role stress and perceptions of supervisory style.
