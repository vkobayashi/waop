The construct ‘work involvement’ was viewed as having three dimensions: job involvement, or psychological identification with the position or job occupied; specialization involvement, or psychological identification with the career or specialization of which the present job is a part; and importance of performance to self-esteem, an individual difference variable akin to the Protestant ethic. Two studies of professional Army officers are described (n = 100, and n = 384). Factor analysis of questionnaire items supported the hypothesis that the three attitudes are distinct. Scales were developed to measure the attitudes, and assessments of their validity and reliability are presented.
