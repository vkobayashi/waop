This study investigated the relationship between rater characteristics, rating errors and rater accuracy. Several types of rater characteristics were studied: personality, cognitive and job-related variables, and rater beliefs about human nature. It was hypothesized that rater beliefs would correlate significantly with both rating errors and rater accuracy and that there would be a significant relationship between accuracy and rating errors. The results supported the first hypothesis. However, rating errors and rating accuracy were not significantly correlated. Practical implications of these results are discussed.
