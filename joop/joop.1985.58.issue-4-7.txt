This note describes a field study of appraisal ratings in a number of British government departments. The study examines sex differences in ratings of overall performance, promotability and long-term potential. The findings on overall performance reinforce the currently unclear picture. The figures for promotability and long-term potential extend the existing body of knowledge and introduce new difficulties of interpretation. The note comments on these difficulties and on corrective action.
