Using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), the role of behavioural, normative, and control beliefs and individualism/collectivism was examined in the context of job seeking for temporary employment. Data were collected in a two-wave longitudinal design, using a culturally diverse sample of 138 temporary workers in The Netherlands. Results supported the TPB-relationships, with the exception of the role of perceived behavioural control (PBC). Of the behavioural beliefs, sense of security, workâ€“life balance, and status were most strongly related to intentions to seek temporary employment. Further, hypothesized moderating effects of collectivism were confirmed such that people low on collectivism were more strongly motivated by their personal attitudes about job seeking and less by perceptions of social pressure than people high on collectivism. Thus, the TPB was demonstrated to work somewhat differently depending on people's cultural value orientations.
