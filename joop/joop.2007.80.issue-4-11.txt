This study examines antecedents of turnover intention and job performance in China. The total sample consisted of 153 employees in a toy manufacturing factory in South China. Data from matched supervisor and subordinate responses supported the hypotheses that the workplace experience of perceived organizational support related to turnover intention which in-turn related to individual job performance. Findings also indicated that the employees with traditional values and positive affectivity related significantly to perceived organizational support.
