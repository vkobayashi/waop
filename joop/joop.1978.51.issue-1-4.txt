A number of American computer-based systems for educational and vocational guidance are reviewed. They illustrate the progressive development from information storage and retrieval systems, through matching to counselling and career development systems. Lessons are drawn from American experience of these systems, pointing out the pitfalls to be avoided both at the strategic level of setting objectives for computer-assisted guidance, and at the technological level of developing suitable hardware, software, and audiovisual components. Directions for the future are suggested.
