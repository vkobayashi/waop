This prospective study of 215 West Midlands shop-floor and office workers reveals significant levels of skill decay in all aspects of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). While confirming findings from most earlier studies on the rapid decay of CPR skills over a period of a few months following training, the study also reveals that other variables exert independent effects upon the skill decay process. These variables are initial level of CPR skill and age and sex of trainee.
