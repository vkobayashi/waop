The Equity Sensitivity Instrument (ESI) was developed to measure equity sensitivity, an equity theory individual difference variable. This paper presents evidence from five samples (N = 2399) supporting the validity of the construct and the ESI as its measurement. Correlations between equity sensitivity and gender, age, education level, social desirability, self-esteem, locus of control, Machiavellianism, pro-Protestant and non-Protestant work ethic, input-outcome orientation, exchange ideology, altruism, organizational commitment, job satisfaction, supervisor satisfaction, propensity to turnover and perceptions of pay justice are presented. Results suggest that equity sensitivity is unique from these other constructs and that the ESI is discriminantly and convergently valid.
