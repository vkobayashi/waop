The construct of new employee anticipation was explored within a model of newcomer socialization. Measures of anticipation, socialization processes and outcomes obtained from new college graduates one year after graduation (N = 378) suggested low-anticipation newcomers report lower job satisfaction, commitment, work motivation, job involvement and psychological success. Graduates who anticipated their jobs perceived organizations as being more receptive to them, jobs as more challenging, greater control over their work, more influence on the organization, and understood the culture better. In addition, graduates who had not anticipated their current jobs reported lower levels of satisfaction with the transition, greater stress and more difficulty with the transition. Implications for socialization research and human resource systems are discussed.
