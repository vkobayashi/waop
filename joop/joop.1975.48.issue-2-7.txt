A role-playing technique was used to investigate the hypothesis that candidates in a mock selection interview would make use of the non-verbal behaviour of the interviewer to form impressions of him. When non-verbal approval and disapproval were compared, the former created a more favourable impression in the candidates. However, non-verbal approval had no effect on the verbal output of candidates, contrary to suggestions that such approval would reinforce verbal behaviour and so increase talking.
