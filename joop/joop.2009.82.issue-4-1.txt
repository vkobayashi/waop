This guest editorial introduces the special section of the Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology ‘Careers research in Europe’. Contributing to the aim of the special section to highlight the value of the European careers research for the benefit of the global community of career scholars, as well as towards advancing researchers' understanding of contemporary careers, the guest editorial discusses two themes. The first theme concerns the importance of incorporating cultural context in career studies. The second theme concerns the value the European multilingual and multicultural context offers for career studies. It is suggested that the value of European research can be seen in the diversity it offers to views on careers. It includes: (a) diversity of social, political, and economic environments; (b) diversity of cultures; and (c) diversity of theories and methods that can be used in career studies.
