The majority of work in organizational behaviour has been conducted at the individual level of theory, measurement and analysis. While the field of organizational behaviour may be viewed as largely mixed-level, incorporating individual, group and organizational-level phenomena, relatively few group-level and mixed-level theories with corresponding levels of research exist. This is particularly problematic for organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) research, since OCB is theorized to exist at multiple levels. Several individual-level and group-level antecedents affect OCB, but it is OCB in the aggregate (i.e. group and organizational level) which impacts organizational effectiveness, which is another organizational-level phenomenon.
A brief review of group-level and mixed-level research methodology is presented and these methods are then applied to a burgeoning area of organizational behaviour research, one which is inherently group and mixed-level, organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB). Implications of the different levels of measurement and analysis for OCB theory development and testing are discussed.
