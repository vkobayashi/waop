Previous research has suggested that workers in large institutions may express lower job satisfaction than those in smaller units, but that the latter may be seen as having some disadvantages. It was hypothesized that this would be so for nursing staff in three psychiatric hospitals of different sizes, and that the lower satisfaction within the largest hospital would be associated with problems of interpersonal communication. A questionnaire study with a total of 483 respondents confirmed the relationship between size and job satisfaction, and the relevance of facets involving communication. It was also confirmed that a small hospital may have particular problems, despite generally high morale.
