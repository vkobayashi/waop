School-leavers deal with important developmental tasks which are to some extent interwoven with the transition from school to the adult work world. But many school-leavers are currently being denied work opportunities. This study used Erikson's notions of psycho-social development to investigate the impact of unemployment on students leaving school and attempting to secure their first job. Those who found work, particularly girls, showed significant psycho-social development while those who returned to school or were unemployed showed none.
