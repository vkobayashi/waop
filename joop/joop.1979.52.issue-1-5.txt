This paper reports a questionnaire survey of final-year engineering students at Imperial College, London. Results indicate considerable self-selection between students' career orientations and their job choices. Most students took jobs in engineering and most of these were within the branch of their training. Those students entering R & D or design had different career orientations from those entering â€˜operations' or from those leaving engineering. The findings also illustrated that three general characteristics associated with inter-occupational choice theory could be observed in a particular intra-occupational context.
