A problem which commonly faces psychologists who are concerned with selection is that of increasing the predictive validity of an existing battery of psychometric tests. The problem arises because, typically, the construct validity of tests is established post hoc. This paper describes a way in which the construct validity of test can be established operationally, via facet analysis. The search for novel predictive validity can then proceed in a systematic way, rather than by the conventional ‘shotgun’ approach. As an example, it describes the construct validation of a test which has been used in the selection of the pilot and navigating officers of aircraft.
