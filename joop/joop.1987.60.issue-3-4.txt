Forty-six empirical studies directly investigating the effects of three classes of nonverbal variables (demographic cues, physical appearance, non-verbal behaviours) on performance appraisal were reviewed. In addition, relevant social psychological and communication research in the areas of person perception and impression formation was highlighted. The review indicated that the effects of non-verbal cues on person perception in general, and performance appraisal in particular, are significant and varied. The review also revealed that (a) the majority of performance appraisal literature has exclusively examined demographic cues, (b) potential interactions among the three classes of non-verbal variables have been generally ignored, and (c) most of the research is non-theoretical. In an attempt to remedy this situation, a conceptual framework within which to examine the impact of non-verbal cues on the performance appraisal process was proposed.
Research in performance has been conducted explicitly for over 40 years (and implicitly since the time of Aristotle). We know lots of little things about the topic. A major obstacle to increasing our understanding of the bigger issues in performance theory seems to be the absence of a clear agenda for research and thinking. We have been bogged down in the technology of performance assessment and have paid little attention to the theory which must support this technology (Landy et al., 1983, p. xi).
