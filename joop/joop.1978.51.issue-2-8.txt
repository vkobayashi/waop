This study explored the validity of the Job Characteristics Model within a job redesign context. The findings upon which the model is based (Hackman & Oldham, 1975) were closely replicated with an homogeneous group of shop-floor employees. However, path analyses showed that the evidence, both for the present investigation and that reported by Hackman & Oldham, was not fully consistent with the model. The implications of the findings are discussed.
