This study examined attitudes towards particular shifts and predictors of overall dissatisfaction with shiftwork. One hundred and thirty female nurses were studied during their first 15 months of shiftwork. Forty-eight worked on a two-shift roster throughout and 82 transferred to a three-shift roster after 6 months. Attitudes were assessed after 6 months (Stage 2) and 15 months (Stage 3). Analysis of variance revealed a significant rise in dissatisfaction scores from Stage 2 to Stage 3, but no shift group or interaction effects. Multiple regression analysis indicated that greater work/non-work conflict, higher psychological symptoms and lower social support from co-workers were associated with dissatisfaction at Stage 2. Greater work/non-work conflict, greater vigour and lower social support from family were associated with dissatisfaction at Stage 3. Nineteen characteristics significantly discriminated between night shift and either day shift or afternoon shift. Night shift rated most negatively on circadian/sleep disturbance and work/non-work conflict effects.
