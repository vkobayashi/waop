Using a sample of medical technologists (MTs) over a 5-year time period, this study's results suggest that occupational entrenchment (Carson, Carson, & Medeian, 1995) may be better represented as a two-dimension, i.e. accumulated costs and limited alternatives, vs. three-dimension, i.e. investments, emotional costs, and limited alternatives, construct. Results show that professional commitment, job satisfaction, job involvement, and organizational support were more strongly positively related to accumulated costs than limited alternatives, while externality (locus of control) and lower work ethic were more strongly related to limited alternatives than accumulated costs. It is speculated that these results may be useful in future research on the broader construct of occupational commitment.
