Goal-setting research and applications of goal setting to organizations are critically examined along a unidmensional/multidimensional continuum. Four relatively unexplored areas in the goal-setting paradigm are considered in detail: (a) the distinction between quantity and quality goals and performance measures, (b) conflicts inherent in goal-setting processes, (c) individual versus group levels of analysis, and (d) laboratory versus field research support for the goal-setting paradigm. The resultant research needs suggest limits to the application of goal setting as well as some needs regarding theory building and research design.
