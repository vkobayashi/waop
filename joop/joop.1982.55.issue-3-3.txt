Work sample tests are assigned to one of four categories: (i) psychomotor, (ii) individual, situational decision making, (iii) job-related information and (iv) group discussion/decision making. Validity data drawn from over 60 studies are presented and show that psychomotor work sample tests and group discussions predict job performance relatively well when compared with more conventional forms of psychological testing, such as intelligence or personality tests. Data showing other validity relationships are presented, and the importance of point-to-point correspondence between predictors and criteria is discussed. Research on the adverse impact of work sample tests and the applicant reaction to such tests is reviewed and suggests that the tests may help to reduce adverse impact and produce positive reactions from candidates.
