This study examined whether perceived work–family conflict would function as a mediator in the link between work–family culture perceptions and self-reported distress. Data were obtained from employees (N=1,297) of five Finnish organizations representing both the public (local social and health care, school, and labour departments) and the private sectors (paper mill, IT company). The results showed that perceived work–family conflict functioned as a partial mediator between employees' perceptions of work–family culture and self-reported distress in two organizations (i.e. in the social and health care department and paper mill), whereas the relationship turned out to be direct in the other three organizations (i.e. the education, labour departments and IT company). Thus, a supportive work–family culture was related directly and indirectly, through reduced work–family conflict, to the well-being of employees.
