The categorical nature of many research variables used in personnel and organizational behaviour presents a serious methodological problem for traditional regression-based data analysis. Because categorical data inherently contain less information than continuous data and require non-traditional statistical techniques, the empirical research has been hindered. This is particularly true of longitudinal studies containing categorical variables which are so often called for in the social science literature, but seldom done. Loglinear modelling is a multivatiate statistical technique that is designed specifically for analysing categorical data. This manuscript presents a longitudinal application of loglinear modelling to a behavioural research question.
