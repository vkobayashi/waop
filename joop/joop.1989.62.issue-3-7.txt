The analysis of the psychological health of strikers presented by Stoner & Arora (1987) presents several problems. The LISREL model that they apparently use is not identified, nor does it fit the publishing data. A reanalysis of the data with an identified model that approximates the authors' model produced parameter estimates which lead to a very different understanding of relationships among the variables. Further analyses showed the data to be empirically under-identified and therefore unsuitable for LISREL analysis. The processes of model selection, data checking and assessment of fit are discussed.
