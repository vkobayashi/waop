The Job Disposition Questionnaire (JDQ) is being developed as an aid to the occupational guidance, selection and placement of young people. The first phase of a long-term study in the Electricity Supply Industry suggests that the JDQ can be used to identify those applicants who have the same attitude to the conditions and content of a job as apprentices with 2 or 3 years' experience; and further, that it can be used to distinguish between the ‘job disposition’ of apprentices in different trades within the apprenticeship scheme. The implication of these results for the usefulness of the JDQ in selecting and placing apprentices in the industry is discussed.
