An argument is developed and tested that a superior's perceived leadership style affects subordinates' information inquiry in an organizational setting. Transformational and transactional leadership theories were utilized to postulate that the content and frequency of information sought by a subordinate from his/her superior will vary depending on that superior's leadership style. This relationship was tested with individual difference predictors such as job-related tolerance for ambiguity, organization-based self-esteem, and work-domain goal orientation of subordinates, in mind. Empirical results, based on the field study using survey data and longitudinal checklist recording, show general support for the model.
