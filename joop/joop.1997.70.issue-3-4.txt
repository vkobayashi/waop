In order to employ superior employees, organizations must attract and select the best applicants. One strategy for attracting better employees is to improve the quality of the recruiters that applicants meet during the job choice process. One approach for improving the quality of recruiters is training. The present study obtained data from 216 recruiters and 1571 matched applicants following employment interviews. Regression results suggest that training influenced recruiters' self-perceptions of their interpersonal effectiveness. However, training had very little effect on applicant perceptions of recruiter effectiveness. Implications for organizational recruitment practice and future research directions are discussed.
