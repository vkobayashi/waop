Advances have occurred in incorporating fuzzy sets into decision theory but these advances have not been applied to the personnel selection process. Rating data obtained from employment interview or performance appraisal settings may, in fact, be particularly appropriate for such a fuzzy decision approach since these data are subjective. One fuzzy set decision approach allowing for importance estimates of various dimensions of a decision (Yager, 1981) is described and applied to two sets of employment interview rating data.
