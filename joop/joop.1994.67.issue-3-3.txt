Goal-setting and feedback techniques, previously used in a study to improve safety in the UK construction industry, were applied to a three-shift production plant, employing approximately 540 people. Critical safety behaviours were identified using accident records and ‘in-depth' interviews. Checklists of critical behaviours were developed for each of 14 departments in the factory. Forty-eight observers were trained to observe their colleagues' safety performance and complete the checklists. ‘Baseline’ measures were taken over a four- to six-week period. Participative goal setting was used to set safety improvement ‘goals’ for the critical behaviours, within each department. Performance feedback was presented graphically in each department on a weekly basis. The results indicate significant improvements in safety performance, with a corresponding reduction in the plant's accident rate. Paradoxically, a statistical inverse relationship was not obtained between safety performance and accident rates, although the importance of non-safety variables in accident causation was demonstrated.
