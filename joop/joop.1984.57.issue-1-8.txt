Measures of reported health change, financial stress, financial strain, and commitment to the labour market were used with a sample of 954 unemployed working-class men, selected to cover equally all levels of age and several levels of length of unemployment. It was found that psychological deterioration, financial stress and strain, and labour market commitment were greatest among middle-aged unemployed men. Deterioration in health and degree of financial strain were found to be greater among men unemployed for longer periods in contrast with those who had more recently become unemployed, but no association was observed between length of unemployment and the measures of financial stress and commitment to the labour market. The probability of having an employed wife was found to be negatively associated with length of unemployment, consistent with the operation of a household strategy for income maintenance.
