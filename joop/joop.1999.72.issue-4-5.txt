This study found that women-friendly policies are not prevalent in organizations in Hong Kong. To ascertain if organizations that are more women-friendly have more committed employees, working men and women in the territory were surveyed. Controlling for ‘national origin of organization’, the research results indicate that family- and work-related factors impact on both women's and men's organizational commitment. But women-friendly policies have a positive impact only on women—and only on their affective commitment, not on continuance commitment. The finding indicates that employees who are more likely to benefit directly from progressive policies that symbolize concern for them would become psychologically more attached to their organizations than those who perceive little value in the policies for their work lives.
