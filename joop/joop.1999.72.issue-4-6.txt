This study reports evidence supporting the discriminant validity of the Strain-Free Negative Affectivity (SFNA) scale (Fortunato & Stone-Romero, 1999). Stressorstrain correlations controlling for neuroticism and negative emotional reactivity (NER), both considered markers of negative affectivity (NA), were examined using partial correlation and latent variable procedures. Support was found for the authors' hypothesis that correlations between self-reports of work-related stressors and physiological and psychological strain would be attenuated to a much greater degree when neuroticism was controlled than when NER was controlled. Thus the SFNA is a viable measure of NA, especially for research examining stressor-strain relations.
