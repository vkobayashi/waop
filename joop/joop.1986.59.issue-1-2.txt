The relationships among engineers' career aspirations, technical obsolescence, personal variables, work characteristics, and perceptions of the organization's reward system were examined in this study. A discriminant function analysis indicated that (a) perceptions of the organization's reward system for management careers and (b) administrative performance were two dimensions that could correctly classify 59Â·8 per cent of the engineers into one of three career-orientation groups. Career orientation was unrelated to the amount of technical updating an engineer was currently engaged in; however, individuals aspiring to management careers were engaged in more coursework of a general, broadening nature. Also, the better technical performers most desired future management careers. Career orientations are discussed in terms of age, career stages, and organizational reward system. Changes in organizational reward systems and in work characteristics are suggested because of their consequences for technical personnel.
