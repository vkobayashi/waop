Just under 400 Chinese and Caucasian managers rated their own managerial behaviour on 30 dimensions that made up six internally consistent behavioural criteria. Likewise between three and five of their directly reporting subordinates completed the same rating form on each manager. These self and subordinate ratings, as well as a measure of congruence between them, were compared to the various standardized and validated ratings of the self-same managers by their superiors on slightly different, but equally psychometrized, measures. The results showed various significant positive correlations of self and subordinate ratings, few between self and superior, and many between subordinate and superior. In other words there was greater similarity between subordinates and superiors than between self-ratings with either. There were few significant cross-cultural differences between the two groups. Regression analysis suggested that the best predictors of the overall supervisor rating was a main effect of a subordinate rating of innovation and two cross-product ‘congruency’ scores relating to motivating staff and commitment. This study partly replicated the finding of Bass & Yammarino (1991), who established that congruence of self and subordinate ratings was related to successful performance.
