In a four-wave panel study the coping styles of case managers hired to work with seriously and persistently mentally ill clients were measured at entry to the job. Workers' degree of stress, strain and negative consequences, such as burnout, job dissatisfaction, physical symptoms, intention to quit and life dissatisfaction, were assessed at subsequent time periods (three, 12 and/or 18 months later). Depending on time period and outcome variable studied, the effect of coping was examined in between 39 and 51 workers. The results showed that control-oriented coping strategies clearly acted as work stress buffers, and that those who relied exclusively on avoidance coping strategies reported higher general levels of negative consequences three months later. Implications were discussed for (a) the measurement of coping, (b) conceptions of coping styles and flexibility, and (c) programmes for assisting workers to deal with burnout arising from challenging work environments.
