The present study introduces a new important variable into a model of training motivation, namely that of being in one's chosen job. Evidence exists that having some control and choice over aspects of training have positive effects on training motivation. We propose that being in one's chosen job will also have such an effect, as it provides trainees with greater autonomy regarding their career progression (e.g., Gagn√© & Deci, 2005) and aligns their training activity closely with their personal goals (e.g., Locke & Latham, 2002). Pre- and post-training surveys were completed by 232 instructors who were themselves on a military training course. Results confirmed the positive effects of being in one's chosen job on the pre-training attitudes of self-efficacy and training motivation with further direct effects on motivation to transfer, and indirect effects on knowledge acquisition and post-training self-efficacy. Findings have both theoretical and practical ramifications. Being in one's chosen job should be incorporated into models of training motivation and, whenever possible, employees being re-deployed should be granted their job preference because this is associated with important positive effects on pre-training attitudes and motivation to transfer new skills to the work environment.
