This report is based on a study conducted on 44 subjects who were applicants for industrial units. The technical committee recommended selection of the applicants on the basis of their entrepreneural potential. A 2 Ã— 2 analysis of variance design emerged on the basis of the committee's judgement (selection or rejection) of each applicant and age of the applicants. Achievement values (vAch) and locus of control of subjects were measured. The results revealed that the applicants selected by the committee showed significantly greater amount of vAch and more internality on the scale of locus of control. The subjects above 35 years in age were found to be lower in vAch combined with less internality than those who were below 35 years of age. Interaction effects did not reach significance for any of these variables. Correlation coefficients of the measures further supported the above results. The implications of these findings are shown in terms of entrepreneural selection and development.
