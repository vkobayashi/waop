Personality variables (negative affectivity, locus of control and two components of Type A behaviour), assessed in a cohort of graduating college seniors, were used approximately one year later to predict reports of job stressors (autonomy, role ambiguity, role conflict, workload, constraints and interpersonal conflict) and job strains (job satisfaction, work anxiety, frustration and somatic symptoms). For all variables, except work frustration, personality was a significant predictor. Possible mechanisms by which personality might affect reports of job stressors and strains, explanations for results, and suggestions for future research are discussed.
