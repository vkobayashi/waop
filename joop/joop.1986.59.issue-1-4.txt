Fox et al. (1983) concluded that halo is not a unitary concept. This paper argues that their conclusion is erroneous and that it is based on a misunderstanding of the role of variance in statistical analysis, a mistaken use of ANOVA to calculate halo, and the confusion of those analyses that measure the similarity in ratings across raters with those that compare the similarities in ratings under different rating conditions.
