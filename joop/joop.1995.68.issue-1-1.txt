Identity theory postulates that the psychological importance or salience of the job role may intensify relationships between job stressors and employee health. Therefore, this study tested the moderating influence of job involvement on the relationships of work pressure, lack of autonomy, and role ambiguity to depression, physical health, and heavy alcohol use. Data were obtained through household interviews with a randomly selected community sample of 795 employed adults. Moderator regression analyses provided limited support for the stress-exacerbating influence of job involvement. Of nine interactions tested, three were significant. Specifically, high levels of job involvement exacerbated the relationships between role ambiguity and physical health, role ambiguity and heavy alcohol use, and work pressure and heavy alcohol use. Implications for future research are discussed.
