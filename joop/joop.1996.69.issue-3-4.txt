Four dimensions of superior–subordinate communication (positive relationship communication, upward openness communication, negative relationship communication, and job-relevant communication) were used to test a role theory explanation for the moderating effect of job level on the communication–job satisfaction relationship. Consistent with a role theory explanation for such a moderating effect, results indicated that the influence of a superior's communication on job satisfaction was significantly greater for supervisors than for hourly employees. All four communication dimensions were significant predictors of hourly employees' job satisfaction. However, while supervisors reported receiving more positive relationship and more upward openness communication, these two dimensions were not significant predictors of their job satisfaction. Implications for both research and management practice are offered.
