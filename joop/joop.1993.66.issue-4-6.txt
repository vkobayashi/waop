This study investigated relationships between raters' perceptions of the purpose of rating (as opposed to objective purpose), norms about the rating process, satisfaction and rating outcomes. Sixty-four managers of 340 employees completed a survey of perceptions of purpose, norms and satisfaction. Performance rating data for subordinates of these managers were culled from files. Results indicated that raters' perceptions and satisfaction were significantly related to halo, leniency and range restriction in ratings. Implications of these findings are discussed.
