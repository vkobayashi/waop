Theories of transformational leadership attempt to describe leadership behaviours which are associated with above average performance by subordinates. Kouzes' and Posner's (1987) visionary leadership describes five key transformational leadership behaviours which can be assessed by the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI: Kouzes & Posner, 1988). This study examined the construct validity of the LPI by using confirmatory factor analysis to test three alternate conceptual models. The sample consisted of 1400 subordinates who worked for an international finance company. It was concluded that LPI assessed an over-arching higher order transformational leadership. The implications of the findings for management development programmes were discussed.
