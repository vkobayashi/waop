Two studies were conducted to determine whether performance ratings are more heavily influenced by raters' perceptions of the ratee's ‘heroism’—that is consistent behaviour in the face of failure—or by raters' perceptions of the ratee's level of success. Effects of ratee gender were also investigated. Neither a student sample (n=179) nor a management sample (n=127) provided evidence in support of a heroism effect; the effects of strategy (consistent or experimenting) and timing of success or failure (immediate or delayed) were relatively small. Success and failure had the strongest and most consistent effects on performance ratings. These results supported the proposition that raters' perceptions of a ratee's performance—level of success—are the primary determinants of ratings, and that ‘heroic’ perseverance in the face of failure does not result in higher ratings.
