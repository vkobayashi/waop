Utilizing a sample of classified university employees, a partial replication of Mobley, Horner, and Hollingsworth's turnover model was initially undertaken. Intermediate linkages of the employee withdrawal decision process studied were job satisfaction, age, tenure, perception of job opportunities, thoughts of quitting, and intention to search. Results were in substantial agreement with the findings of Mobley et al. (1978) and double cross-validated well with their data on hospital employees. Extension of the turnover model was then undertaken by measuring two linkages in the employee withdrawal decision suggested by Mobley (1977): (1) extent of employee search for alternatives; and (2) results of employee search for alternatives. Results of the extension indicated that the two additional intermediate linkages did not fully integrate into the model as hypothesized by Mobley (1977).
