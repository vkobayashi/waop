The validity of pre-employment interviews has been debated for a long period of time. One recently advocated way to improve validity has been to use a panel of two or more interviewers. A cohort of petroleum process technicians was selected by pre-employment tests and the panel interview. The interview predicted job performance and promotions while the pre-employment tests predicted training success and job performance. The panel interview also showed ‘incremental validity’ over and above the pre-employment tests for job performance.
