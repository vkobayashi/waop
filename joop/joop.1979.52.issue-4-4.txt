The small percentage of all employed women holding administrative or managerial positions indicates that women are not reaching those work positions likely to use to the full their potential ability. One suggested reason for this situation is that women neither plan for a business career nor avail themselves of training appropriate for management progression within the business world. The decisive stage in this area is the work choice made while still at school, so a need is seen for a means of identifying girls likely to succeed in business administration. This would enable selection of an appropriate course of study with the aim of entry into business as a manager, rather than following the traditional female secretarial route. In this study of 130 female New Zealand managers, the biographical information was directed at eliciting those life history items pertaining to areas of development and experience likely to provide predictors of managerial effectiveness. The critical factor is the development of an internalized locus of control: the girl who perceives herself as controlling and mastering her adolescent environment is likely to become the woman who succeeds in management.
