This study investigated the feasibility of administering the Vocational Preference Inventory (VPI) by computer. Ninety-nine subjects completed the standard and automated versions of the VPI on an alternate-forms test-retest basis. The two forms were found to be comparable. Consequently, it is recommended that the use of the computerized version of this test be continued.
