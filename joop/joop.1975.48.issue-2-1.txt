Preliminary studies suggested that briefing police officers by television led to greater recall than the traditional face-to-face method. A more closely controlled test with trainee constables, in which the contents of briefings were the same for the two methods, showed that information presented via television was not better recalled but conversely that television briefing was not worse than the traditional method. Varying the contents of briefings showed that nine items per briefing produced less recall than either seven or eight items. More experienced trainees recalled more than those who were in their first year of duty.
