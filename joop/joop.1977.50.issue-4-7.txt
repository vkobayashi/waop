Four layouts for a questionnaire were designed and a comparison made between them in terms of cost of production, ease of completion, and speed of data retrieval and coding. The results indicated no significant differences in terms of speed of completion and coding, but that cost-benefits would emerge for different layouts, particularly if traditional printing methods of production were employed.
