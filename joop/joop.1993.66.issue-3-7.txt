As a step towards increased understanding of upward rating processes, this study examined organizational and demographic correlates of agreement between subordinate ratings of the supervisor and the supervisor's self-ratings on motivation and performance items. Agreement measures included profile agreement (the correlation between the profile of ratings across items) and difference scores (the difference between the subordinate rating minus the self-rating averaged across items). The hypotheses were derived from theory and research on organizational differences, impression management and interpersonal similarity. Variables examined as correlates of agreement included organizational type (military, government, large corporations and small private firms), demographic characteristics of raters and ratees (gender, race and age), and subordinates' participation in career planning. Regression analyses of data from 54 work groups showed lower self/subordinate profile agreement in the government/non-military than the other types of organizations. Results also showed higher profile agreement for same race than different race supervisor/subordinate dyads. Supervisors over age 55 rated themselves more favourably than their subordinates rated them. Profile agreement was positively related to participation in career planning. Ways to avoid rater biases and calibrate organizational differences in upward ratings are discussed.
