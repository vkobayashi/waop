Cross-sectional research provides consistent evidence that workâ€“family conflict is positively associated with a host of adverse health-related outcomes. The authors extend past research by examining the longitudinal relations of work <U+2192> family and family <U+2192> work conflict to self-report (depressive symptomatology, physical health, and heavy alcohol use) and objective cardiovascular (incidence of hypertension) health outcomes. Survey data were obtained from a random community sample of 267 employed parents during 1989 (baseline) and 1993 (follow-up). Ordinary least squares and logistic regression analyses revealed that family <U+2192> work conflict was longitudinally related to elevated levels of depression and poor physical health, and to the incidence of hypertension. In contrast, work <U+2192> family conflict was longitudinally related to elevated levels of heavy alcohol consumption.
