In order to improve a process-information system, operators' process-control tasks were analysed according to the method of Annett et al. (1971). This method, in which tasks are described in a hierarchical way, was developed for training operators to perform their tasks. Adaptation of the method to analyse process-control tasks is described, and its potential applications elsewhere are considered.
