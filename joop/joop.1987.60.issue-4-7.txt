This study represents an effort to determine the differential effects of age and education on perceptions of occupational attractiveness. A total of 463 respondents ranging from high school seniors to college seniors rated the attractiveness of 41 job dimensions. Results indicated significant independent effects for both age and education on attractiveness ratings. An analysis of covariance demonstrated that education had a significant effect while age did not, suggesting that education is the more important influence.
