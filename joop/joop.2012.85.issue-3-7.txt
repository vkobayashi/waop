This research draws on family systems theory to examine the influence of the significant other on employees’ job search behaviours. Data from 102 matched pairs of employees and their significant others showed that significant others’ perception of the employee's work-to-family conflict was positively related to the employee's job search activity after controlling for employee self-reported work-to-family conflict. Contributions and implications are discussed.
