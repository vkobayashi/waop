The findings are described of an investigation comparing the career preferences of 589 girls and 437 boys in the lower sixth forms of Belfast grammar schools. For each sex, career choices tended to follow traditional patterns, with girls having lower career aspirations than boys. In general, both sexes expressed similar attitudes to marriage and related career issues.
