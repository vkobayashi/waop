A participant observation method was employed in the study of a 20-week strike at Ansells Brewery Ltd, a constituent company of Allied Breweries (UK). The strike, involving 1000 workers, began in opposition to the implementation of a four-day working week and culminated in the permanent closure of the brewery. The strike's development is analysed according to a social-cognitive approach, based on the psychological imagery, beliefs, values and perceptions underlying the employees' behaviour. By also adopting a historical perspective, it has been possible to show how contemporary definitions of reality are shaped by the prior history of union-management relations, particularly with regard to the way that previous events were subjectively interpreted, and the lessons that were learned on the basis of that experience.
