Studies investigating the transference of stress have shown that occupational stressors are transmitted from the job incumbent to a cohabiting partner, affecting not only his/her physical and psychological health but life expectancy as well. These studies remain limited in that they are based on simple bivariate correlations and hence are open to the criticism that: (i) causality has not been demonstrated; (ii) the observed correlations may be due to uncontrolled confounding influences. This study aims to overcome these limitations by using a longitudinal design where job characteristics ‘naturally’, but predictably, fluctuate to identify the causal relationship between one partner's job and the other partner's distress. The sample comprised 82 Navy couples (54 sea-based and 28 shore-based personnel). The job stressors under investigation included the deployment of the seagoing partner and his perceptions of job characteristics (role ambiguity, conflict and work overload). Both the impact on partner well-being of objective and subjective perceptions of job characteristics were included in the present study. The results showed that the well-being of the partners who remain at home fluctuates as a function of deployment status and the mariners' perceptions of their job characteristics. It is concluded that the seagoing partners' job characteristics do have a causal influence on the well-being of their partners.
