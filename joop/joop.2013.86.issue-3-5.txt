A key theme from the previous commentaries is that the business case for developing supportive supervisors needs to be stronger for organizations to make the investments necessary to develop supportive supervisors. There are time constraints and other practical considerations for those in the role of supervisor that may get in the way of supportive supervision unless supervisor support is recognized as a valuable business expense (Ellinger, 2013; Zeni, MacDougall, Chauhan, Brock, & Buckley, 2013). As such, in our response to the commentaries, we present the findings of an additional analysis based on the data from our original sample that examine the relationship between supportive supervision (as rated by subordinates) and supervisor performance and promotability (as rated by the supervisor's boss). We provide evidence that highly supportive supervisors are seen as more promotable and as better performers than are supervisors who are less supportive. Having empirical evidence that shows that upper-level leaders believe that supportive management contributes to the performance of supervisors is important because upper-level leaders are the ones making decisions in organizations about what is valued and promoted.
