There is an increasing interest in Africa as a potential sourcing location and a target for foreign direct investment (FDI). However, because of the uniqueness of the African context, there is a need to investigate whether management theories that have worked effectively in organizations in developed countries may be applicable within the African context. In this study, using a multiple case study approach, we investigated change implications and the effectiveness of implementing flexible work practices in local firms in Nigeria. Our results revealed that employees in local firms in Nigeria were compliant with the introduction of the practices, despite their negative perceptions about the potential impact of implementing the change and the ‘management of change’ process. Our study revealed that social, cultural, and religious factors, along with the value systems of the Nigerian context played a major role in influencing employees’ reaction to the successful implementation of the flexible work practices. The implications of the study for theory and practice within the broader African context are discussed.
