Traditional assessment centre design involves the identification of a set of performance-related traits (dimensions). These dimensions are used as a basis for the design of exercises and are used by assessors to rate candidates' performance. This paper examines the psychometric properties of four UK-based assessment centres and, in particular, the extent to which the ratings produced by assessors demonstrate both convergent and discriminant validity. The results indicate that within-exercise ratings of different traits correlate more highly than across-exercise ratings of the same trait. Factor analyses of the data reveal that underlying factors represent exercises and not dimensions. The implications of the results for the design of assessment centres are discussed.
