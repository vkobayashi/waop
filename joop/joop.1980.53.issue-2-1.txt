Participation can either be ‘imposed’ on an organization or be encouraged to develop from within through fostering an atmosphere of trust and cooperation between employees and management. This is an account of the implementation within the Port of London Authority of a scheme whose objectives were to enhance communications between all levels of the workforce in the hope that an atmosphere of mutual trust and support would develop. The Work Group Discussion Scheme, as it was called, provided a mechanism whereby problems could be tackled at local level using vertically structured discussion groups. The scheme was assessed over an 18 month period and the results indicated an improvement in communications, more constructive attitudes amongst the workforce, and a drop in industrial disputes.
