Changes in self-perceived ability as a function of performance in an assessment centre were evaluated. Centre participants (n = 1693) provided self-ratings on eight ability dimensions before and immediately after the assessment centre experience. Performance measures on five different exercises were provided by assessors. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated significant changes in perceived ability on five of the eight assessment centre dimensions. Further, the effect of specific centre exercises reflected changes in self-perceived ability (e.g. planning and organizing) which were consistent with the type of exercise (e.g. in-tray) under study. Suggestions for further research on self-assessments specifically in the context of assessment centre participation are provided.
