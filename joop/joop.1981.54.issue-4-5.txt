Individual and structural characteristics were combined in this multidimensional study of managerial job satisfaction. One thousand, one hundred and fifty-eight managers from three organizations were given the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire. A factorial nested analysis of variance was used to test hypotheses. Independent variables were age, education, and hierarchical level; and the dependent variables were four specific job satisfaction factor scores plus a global dimension. Results indicate that the structural characteristic of hierarchical level has the most significant pervasive effect on managers' job satisfaction; and that, when individual characteristics do have significant effect, it is most frequently within the top level of management. Results also indicate a very strong relationship between satisfaction with personal progress and development and overall job satisfaction.
