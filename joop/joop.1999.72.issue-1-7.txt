A notable feature of research designed to investigate the predictors of future employment status is the absence of any theoretical framework. The ability of expectancy-value theory to predict future employment status was evaluated by interviewing 200 young unemployed people and measuring their employment status (unemployed, temporarily or permanently employed) 10-12 months later. Job expectancy and job importance predicted future employment status, separated the three groups of employment status at follow-up, and mediated the full relationship between background variables and future employment status. Overall, expectancy-value theory appears a useful framework in which to investigate the predictors of future employment status.
