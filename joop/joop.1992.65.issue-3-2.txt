The discriminant validity of measures used to assess job satisfaction, positive affectivity and negative affectivity was empirically evaluated using data collected from a sample of 550 employees of a 327-bed Veterans Administration Medical Center. Confirmatory factor analysis with LISREL as the estimation technique was used to test the hypothesized three-factor configuration. Results of this test and other data supported the discriminant validity of the three constructs.
