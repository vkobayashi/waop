It is proposed that the low reliability and validity of selection interviews are partly explicable in terms of the nature of the attributions made to personal characteristics. Specifically, appropriate attributions based on out-of-role behaviour are not made because of attributional biases and/or conflicting role expectations. Both these factors result in the drawing of dispositional attributions from behaviour which is inappropriate for such inferences. Training of interviewers to minimize attributional biases and maximize agreement of role expectations at the beginning of each interview are recommended, both as tests of the theory and as remedial measures.
