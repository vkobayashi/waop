Three different answer sheets were used in the administration of the General Aptitude Test Battery to groups of young adults (n = 302). The answer sheets, designed for use with different brands of Optical Mark Reader, varied in the shape of the response space. A two-factor, repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significant interaction between subtests and type of answer sheet. Further analyses showed that performance on ‘speed’ tests was affected by the format of answer sheet used, whereas performance on mainly ‘power’ tests was not. The implications of the results for testing practice are discussed.
