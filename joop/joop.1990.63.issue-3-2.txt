Assessees at two assessment centres (N = 117 and N = 157) completed personality inventories and aptitude tests. Correlations between personality attributes and assessment dimensions were generally low, and suggested that some attributes permitted competencies to be expressed in behaviour. Correlations between intellectual aptitude and dimensions were higher, with aptitude being related to the more cognitive dimensions. Implications for assessment centre practice are explored.
