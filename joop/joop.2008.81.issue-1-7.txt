This research investigates the prediction of post-retirement work. Unlike prior research, we examined both paid and volunteer post-retirement work, showing the similarities and differences in their prediction. Using multinomial logistic regression analysis, a framework based on image theory was tested, which included evaluations of pre-retirement work, attitudes to retirement, behavioural style and demographics, and used to predict both intentions to work in retirement in a pre-retiree sample (N = 987) and actual work in retirement in a sample of retirees (N = 725). Both volunteer and paid post-retirement work were strongly related to people's evaluation of their pre-retirement work and for pre-retirees, a proactive style of behaviour was also predictive. However, gender, health and retirement satisfaction more related to volunteer work and education to paid work.
