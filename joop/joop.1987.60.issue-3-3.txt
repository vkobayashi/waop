Previous research has suggested that cognitive schemata serve as organizing frameworks which direct rater attention, categorization, integration and recall of ratee behaviour. It has been suggested that raters with more valid schemata, i.e. with cognitive organizing structures which are more sensitive to relevant ratee behaviours, rate more accurately. The study described here examined rater accuracy as a function of schemata derived from past experience and as a function of “imposed” schemata. Subjects were drawn from three populations (undergraduates, MBA students and personnel managers) who were expected to use successively more valid schemata for rating three videotaped personnel managers. Half of the subjects in each population were familiarized with the rating scales prior to ratee observation in order to impose schemata that incorporated the relevant performance rating dimensions. Multiple regression analysis indicated that raters who were expected to have acquired more valid schemata from experience, based on population membership and number of previous performance appraisals conducted personally, rated more accurately. In addition, they generated a greater number of relevant performance dimensions prior to ratee observation. Familiarization with the rating scales did not result in greater accuracy, perhaps due to the limited time made available for familiarization. Results are discussed with respect to past rater schemata research and the need to consider various types of schemata that raters may be using simultaneously.
