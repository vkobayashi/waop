Published and unpublished studies evaluating the merits of occupational stress management are reviewed. Worksite stress management studies are compared along dimensions of type of work group, programme orientation and format, stress management methods, non-specific effects, and long-term maintenance of skills and benefits. Although studies differ widely on these dimensions and too few studies have been conducted to state unequivocally general conclusions, worksite stress management programmes appear to offer promise for helping workers cope with stress and exert greater control over physiological and psychological systems which are reactive to stressors. Troublesome issues in this young research area are noted and future research needs are enumerated. Finally, the advantages and potential disadvantages of worksite stress management programmes are described.
