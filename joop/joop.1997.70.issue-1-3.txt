The present study examined age differences in the production of errors in the context of computer-based work. An action theory-based error taxonomy was used as the basis for categorizing errors as functions of levels of action regulation. Based on laboratory studies of ageing and cognitive and psychophysiological processes, it was hypothesized that older workers would make significantly more errors than younger workers at higher (intellectual) and lower (sensorimotor) levels of regulation but not at the more automated intermediate (flexible action pattern) levels. To test these propositions, data from an observational field study with office workers in several firms were analysed. Correlational analyses revealed a general lack of significant age differences in the number of errors made. However, older workers made significantly more errors than younger workers at intellectual levels of regulation after controlling for work experience factors. Furthermore, stronger significant ageâ€“intellectual error relationships emerged under high levels of cognitive work demands. Significant age-sensorimotor relationships were not found under any condition. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.
