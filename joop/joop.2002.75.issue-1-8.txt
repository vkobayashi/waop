Our longitudinal field study investigated the relationship between team potency and team effectiveness. The sample for this study was drawn from 71 change management teams from an automotive firm in the USA. Team potency ratings were obtained from team members. Team effectiveness ratings were obtained from team members, team leaders and external raters. Results indicated that team effectiveness and team potency are reciprocally and longitudinally related (p< .01).
