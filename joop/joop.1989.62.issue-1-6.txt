This paper introduces a multifaceted construct labelled ‘employee focus of attention’. Conceptual and operational definitions for the construct are provided. Evidence from four different studies is presented to establish content, construct and face validity for the operationalization. Data support the general hypothesis that the degree to which employees think about various targets in their work environment affects their reactions to those targets. It is concluded that with further development the focus of attention construct may provide a viable way to enhance explanations of employee reactions to their work environments. Suggestions for future research on the focus of attention construct are provided.
