Nine hundred and ninety-one newly blinded and visually handicapped adults were tested with the Purdue Pegboard test of manual dexterity while they were undergoing vocational rehabilitation. Normative data were derived to enable comparisons to be made among various subgroups of the population on the basis of degree of residual vision, which together with the gender of the subjects is shown to be a significant determining variable. The results are also discussed in terms of the magnitude of the disparity between the performance of the visually impaired and the fully sighted adult subjects on whom the test was originally standardized.
