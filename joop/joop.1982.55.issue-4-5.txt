As part of a study of the selection of candidates for pilot training in the Army Air Corps, EPI scores have been analysed in relation to success in training. Data from 432 AAC and 205 RAF student pilots have been examined. Statistical analyses show that EPI scores are related to success in training. Possible underlying reasons for this relationship are discussed.
Both samples were more Stable than the general population at the beginning of their training. In addition, there is evidence for positive correlations with success in training for both Stability and Extraversion. As EPI scores are independent of existing selection test scores, improvements in the prediction of success might be achieved if they were taken into account. However, ‘faking-good’ may be a problem.
