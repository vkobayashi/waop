Porter and Lawler's job performance model postulates that performance is an interactive function of effort, role perceptions and ability. The additive and interactive predictions of this model were investigated using an improved operationalization of the expectancy theory constructs in conjunction with a redefinition of role perceptions. Specifically, role perceptions were defined as role ambiguity, conflict and dissensus. Consistent with previous research, the data indicated that the interactive formulation was not superior to the additive job performance model. Perceived performance feedback was hypothesized to moderate predictions of the job performance model. The results supported the hypothesized moderating influence of feedback upon the job performance model and the expectancy theory constructs. However, feedback did not affect predictions of effort.
