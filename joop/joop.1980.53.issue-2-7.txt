This study is an exploration of some of the factors important in determining a man's subjective reaction to the experience of unemployment. Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire was used as a normative measure of mental health, and a Present Life Satisfaction Scale was used as a measure of subjective well-being. Length of unemployment was inversely correlated with mental health and well-being; and semi-skilled and unskilled men had poorer psychological well-being during unemployment than those of higher occupational status. The best single predictor of mental health during unemployment was whether or not a man felt his time was occupied.
