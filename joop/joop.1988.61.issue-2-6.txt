It is argued that the identification of similarities in preferred ways of working and associated personality characteristics within occupational groups constitutes a ‘cognitive climate’ within the overall organizational climate. The empirical evidence for this hypothesis is reviewed, together with studies which examine the effects of inferred forces which act on the individual who finds him/herself in an ‘alien’ cognitive climate: selective recruitment and turnover; reported pressures and coping behaviour; interpersonal clashes. The implications of cognitive fit with regard to team functioning, tolerance and cohesion are discussed.
