This study concerns the development of a technology of synthetic validity derived from a structured job analysis technique (the Position Analysis Questionnaire) and its related attribute bank. Attribute profiles are generated on three alternative bases for a sample of seven jobs. The resultant sets of profiles are assessed in terms of their reliability. The validities of the alternative approaches are assessed in terms of the accuracy of indications in relation to the actual mean scores of job incumbents on related aptitude tests. One approach is shown to offer significantly higher levels of reliability and validity, and is discussed as a basis for synthetic validation and validity generalization.
