This paper outlines field and experimental research on third party intervention in industrial disputes. The majority of research has been carried out on the basis of an instrumental, individualistic model of social relations, which conceives of mediators as conciliatory devices and arbitrators as threatening devices. The main aim of research has been to demonstrate, in terms of a relatively simple causal model of behaviour, the effectiveness of such interventions in producing settlements, but the results have been mixed. First, conciliatory techniques, which are directed at improving personal relations, seem to be most useful in disputes where negotiators are not committed to represent a party and where negotiations themselves are primarily interpersonal and without long-term consequences. The same techniques are likely to be regarded suspiciously or interpreted differently in actual conflicts between employers and unions. Second, given that the favoured norm of the parties is voluntary settlement, arbitration is regarded paradoxically as more successful the less it is used. Comparisons of types of arbitration suggest that parties will act strategically, depending on whether they expect the arbitrator to offer a compromise solution or choose the final offer of either side. In general, it can be argued that third parties are also parties to negotiation rather than ‘neutrals’. The positivist approach adopted by the majority of researchers has resulted in very restricted models of third party intervention and little work has been carried out on the development of an interpretative model of third party processes. Many interesting psychological processes have therefore been excluded: in particular, the normative frameworks which define socially acceptable forms of dispute and legitimate types of argument.
