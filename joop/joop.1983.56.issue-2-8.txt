Five work-related objective and attitudinal factors and five non-work-related individual difference and family dynamics variables considered pertinent to the dual-career family setting, were examined for their impact on the quality of life enjoyed by husbands and wives in dual-career families. For the purpose of this study, a dual-career family was defined as one where both spouses had full-time jobs outside of their home. The responses of 127 dual-career family spouses employed in five business organizations, a hospital and a university were analysed. Results indicated that: (1) the set of five non-work variables—multiple role stresses, enabling processes, integration of family and work roles, self-esteem, and hired help utilized—were good predictors of life satisfaction; (2) the work-relevant variables—career salience, job involvement, self-esteem from the job, discretionary time spent on job-related activities, and income were significant but not crucial predictors of job satisfaction; (3) the interactions between work-relevant variables and gender moderated the impact of the work variables on job satisfaction; (4) the correlation between life and job satisfaction was significant, but modest; and (5) there was a significant difference between the life satisfaction of husbands and wives in dual-career families.
