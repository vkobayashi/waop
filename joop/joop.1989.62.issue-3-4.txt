In this study dimensions of burnout were compared in a human services sample of 81 nurses and a non-human services sample of 194 mid-career managers on an MBA course. A measure of burnout, and certain postulated facets of burnout, were assessed through a self-report questionnaire. An indicator of psychological type was also administered since, it is argued, a confounding of personality with occupation may have occurred in early studies of burnout. It was found that emotional demands and a lack of caring for others were associated with the measure of burnout only for that psychological type which is overrepresented in the human services. For a different psychological type, which is over-represented in managerial occupations, the measure of burnout was associated instead with mental demands and lower ambitiousness. This suggests that previous findings about burnout may merely be a product of research being conducted in an occupation, the human services, within which is a predominance of a particular psychological type.
