This study examines the relationship between the number of prior moves, time living in an area and psychological reactions of employees undergoing job relocation. Relocating employees from a single organization completed questionnaires on average six weeks before and 10 weeks after their move. Results show that the greater the number of prior moves the lower was the reported stress following the move. However, the relationship between number of prior moves and well-being also followed a quadratic trend such that those with few and those with many prior moves reported the greatest stress. Furthermore, the longer the relocator had lived in the area prior to moving, the greater was the general stress and the job-related anxiety and depression following the move.
