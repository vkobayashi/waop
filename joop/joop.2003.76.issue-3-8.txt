We examine whether attainment of goals at work is associated with enhanced affective well-being and whether attainment of personally more important goals has a stronger association with affective well-being. Data were collected from call-centre staff using a daily diary for 2 weeks. Results indicate that daily attainment of work goals is associated with more activated affect measured at the end of the working day. The relationship between attainment of goals and pleasurable affect is stronger where goals are personally more important.
