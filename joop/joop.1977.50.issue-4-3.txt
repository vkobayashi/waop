The paper reports the results of an investigation conducted in 17 public corporations focusing on the relationship between role conflicts arising from divergent orientations among chief executives and board members, and feelings of role stress among the chief executives. Two types of role conflicts, person-role and intersender role conflict, were related to three indices of role stress: ‘anomie’, ‘self-role stress’, and ‘intersender role stress’. The findings indicate that the various types of role conflicts are differentially associated with the various indices of role stress. Among others it was found that intersender role conflicts, i.e. disagreements among the board members, are in some cases negatively associated with role stress among chief executives. The saliency of role conflicts and the degree to which they concern the day-to-day management of the corporation appear to be positively related to role stress among chief executives.
