The purpose of this study is to examine the within- and cross-domain influences of work and family domain stressors and support on two forms of workâ€“family conflict (i.e. WIF: work interference with family, and FIW: family interference with work). To test our hypotheses, we collected multi-source data from 248 Hong Kong employees and their spouses. Among the proposed work domain antecedents of WIF, time commitment and work role expectation were significant. Among the proposed family domain antecedents of FIW, parental demands were significant. Direct cross-domain effects included family role expectation and parental demand on WIF and work role expectation and family-friendly policies on FIW. Tests of the moderating effects of work and family support resulted in support for both within-domain and cross-domain interactions. Implications for researchers and human resource managers are discussed.
