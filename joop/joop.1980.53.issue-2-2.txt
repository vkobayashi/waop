Skill is discussed in terms of efficient ‘strategies’ for relating demands of jobs to human physical and mental capacities. Strategies differ between individuals and within individuals on different occasions. Also, for most normal tasks, not one but several strategies are employed to map different aspects of demand on to corresponding capacities, performance being limited by the capacity most fully used. Strategies tend to be organized hierarchically, with longer-term strategies coordinating shorter-term. It is the former which constitute what are commonly regarded as higher-order skills. Similar principles appear to underlie both shop-floor skills and those involved in management, intellectual and other non-manual activities.
Much laborious research is needed to determine the basic capacities important in various types of work and how far training can be given which is general rather than specific to particular jobs. However, present knowledge already provides important implications for training flexibility of skill, and for the selection of personnel.
