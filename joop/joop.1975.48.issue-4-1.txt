The development of a training course on fault finding in a crude distillation unit is described and its contents illustrated. The criterion problem for this and similar industrial problem-solving tasks is discussed. ‘Operational’, or product measures, namely, first shot successes (FSS), wrong diagnoses (WD) and diagnosis time (T), are reported and compared with five measures of the problem-solving process. Training substantially increased FSS, substantially reduced T and reduced WD by an order of magnitude. Post-training scores were superior to those of men with refinery operating experience, although the difference in T was not statistically significant. Large and significant improvements were also found with the majority of the process measures. The training course only required five sessions of 2½ hours including pre- and post-tests.
