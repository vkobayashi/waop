The study reported in this paper tested hypotheses concerning the relationship between the individual's job valence perceptions and his perceptions of job preference and anticipated job satisfaction. Within-subject analysis was used to examine the predictive validity of five alternative forms of a valence model. Strong support was found for the traditional Vroomian valence model and several alternatives. No evidence was found suggesting the alternative models were superior to the Vroomian model. The predictive validities of the models were highest in the prediction of anticipated higher-order need satisfaction and lowest in the prediction of lower-order need satisfaction.
