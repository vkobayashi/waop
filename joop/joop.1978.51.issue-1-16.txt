Vocational guidance has been a traditional area of interest for occupational psychologists for more than half a century. Its ‘technology’ has centred largely on the skills and experience of counsellors. This paper argues that the present technology is far from ideal and that computer-based systems overcome many of the present shortcomings. It is also argued that, in the first instance, a simple batch processing system is the most realistic proposition. Finally, a brief description is given of a computer program to write vocational guidance reports.
