We have attempted to explore the inconsistent results in the literature concerning employee reactions to workspace density by examining the simultaneous moderating effects of job complexity and organizational tenure on the relationship between workspace density and three attitudinal outcomes: organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and co-worker satisfaction. We found the strongest negative relations between density and reactions when job complexity and organizational tenure were high, simultaneously. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.
