Writing apprehension, the apprehension an individual has about the active encoding of written messages, was hypothesized to affect both the desirability and choice of occupations. High writing apprehensives found occupations with low writing requirements significantly more desirable than occupations with high writing demands. A trend, in the opposite direction, for low apprehensive subjects was also observed. Occupational choices of high writing apprehensives were significantly lower in perceived communication requirements than those selected by low writing apprehensives.
