Theoretical and empirical arguments that support the construct validity of the Allinson-Hayes Cognitive Style Index are reviewed in the light of Hodgkinson and Sadler-Smith's (2003) assertion that Allinson and Hayes (1996) incorrectly specified the nature of the Cognitive Style Index (CSI) as a measure of intuition-analysis predicated on a unitarist conception of the construct. It is concluded that Hodgkinson and Sadler-Smith fail to offer a robust challenge to either the theoretical or empirical arguments supporting the construct validity of the Cognitive Style Index.
