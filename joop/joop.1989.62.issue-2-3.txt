Occupational correlates of Type A behaviour were examined in a sample of 432 men and women employed in managerial and professional roles in a government service. Type A behaviour was, as expected, related to some aspects of the job profile and to occupational level as a whole. However, the relationship between Type A behaviour and occupational level was itself related to self-imposed time commitments to the job. The data indicate, therefore, that Type A individuals achieve occupational status at least partly because they are willing to devote discretionary time to their employment. The implications of this for further epidemiological study of coronary heart disease risk are discussed.
