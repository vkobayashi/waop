Interest tests often employ forced choice methods in which the subject is asked to state his preferences among a range of items. A major difficulty with the resulting scores is that the absolute strengths of the subject's interests, in terms of liking and disliking, cannot be inferred from the preferences alone. A much fuller picture can be obtained by eliciting from the subject both preference and like-dislike responses to the test items but this yields two sets of score data which can give rise to difficulties in interpretation. This paper describes a simple algorithm by which such responses can be integrated into a single, readily interpretable, set of scores in the range 0 to 100. The procedure is not confined to interest tests but can be applied to any situation where similar ranking and rating procedures are used in parallel.
