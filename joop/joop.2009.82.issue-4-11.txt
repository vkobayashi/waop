This study examined the effects of organizational values on employee attachment. Factor analytic results across two studies indicated that organizational values cluster into interdependent and independent factors. In Study 2, organizational values data were collected from supervisors, and identity and attachment data were collected from subordinates. As predicted, relationships involving interdependent and dependent values were contingent on employee identity. Specifically, interdependent organizational values predicted turnover cognition and organizational commitment for employees who reported strong collective identities. Independent organizational values, on the other hand, predicted the commitment of employees with strong individual identities. Implications of these results and directions for future research are discussed.
