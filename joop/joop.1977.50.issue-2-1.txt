Six months after closure of their steelworks, 1655 ex-employees were interviewed. The main purpose of the study was to evaluate a programme of retraining provided to assist redundant people to obtain new work. Job finding was seen to be associated with a combination of retraining, age and work orientation. Ex-employees who had received pre-closure training reported a stronger preference for their new jobs than did non-trainees, but there were no differences between these groups in post-redundancy wage levels. Job-seeking behaviour was also examined and compared to the patterns described in earlier studies. Recommendations were made for retraining procedures in future redundancy situations.
