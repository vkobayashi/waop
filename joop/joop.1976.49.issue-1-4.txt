There is some evidence of the predictive value of attitudes in psychiatric rehabilitation. It is suggested that the most satisfactory way of assessing relevant attitudes is through specially developed questionnaires. Data are presented about the correlational structure of such a questionnaire in both a preliminary and a revised form. It is concluded that separate scales can be constructed to measure dimensions apparently equivalent to the concepts of confidence, perceived illness, perceived support and keenness to work.
