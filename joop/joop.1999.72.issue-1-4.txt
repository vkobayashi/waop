Job-search studies possess a disturbing lack of consistency in the operationalization of search success. This prevents researchers from attaining their goal of explaining and predicting the use of job information sources and search activities. In the current study, we examined two theoretical models that depicted structural relations among nine success criteria often employed in the job-search literature. Overall, the criteria are weakly related to each other. The findings suggest the importance of careful consideration of the meaning and process of job-search success criteria, and that these issues should not be further overlooked.
