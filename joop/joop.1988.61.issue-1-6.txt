While governments are making attempts to attract young people into scientific and technical training programmes, these have yet to have any significant impact on numbers taking such training. This paper reports findings from a large, cross-regional survey of factors influencing young people's (13â€“18-year-olds) motivations to take technological training. By focusing on teenagers' perceptions of the influence parents have exerted over their educational and occupational choices it has been possible to demonstrate that indirect, rather than direct, forms of parental influence are significant in the formation of this motivational state. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to policy and our understanding of socialization processes.
