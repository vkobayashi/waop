We examined the effects of gender and work-groups' perceptions of climate for sexual harassment on the relationship between individuals' sexual harassment experiences and job-related outcomes (namely, job satisfaction, affective organizational commitment, work withdrawal, and job withdrawal). Drawing from a variety of theories, we proposed that a beneficial climate would buffer men from negative outcomes, but would intensify negative outcomes for women. Significant three-way interactions were found for job satisfaction, affective organizational commitment, and job withdrawal. Results indicated that beneficial work-group climate perceptions buffered men from decrements in job satisfaction and work withdrawal, but intensified decrements in all three outcomes for women. Implications for research and practice are discussed.
