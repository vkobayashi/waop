A number of researchers have looked for a direct relationship between a manager's need for achievement (nAch) and his performance, but with mixed success. Few studies, however, have considered the moderating effect of perceived climate on the nAchâ€“performance relationship. In the present investigation two such hypotheses are tested. Firstly, it was expected that a positive correlation between nAch and performance would be more likely to occur when a manager perceives the job climate in strong achievement terms. Data gathered from three samples tend to support this. The second hypothesis was that the maximal point of performance would be where high nAch and high climate coincided, and the minimal point would be where low nAch and low climate coincided. Only the first part of this hypothesis is consistently supported. The practical implications of the findings are discussed.
