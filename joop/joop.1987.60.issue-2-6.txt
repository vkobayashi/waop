Following Cotgrove's (1982) thesis that there is a stable relationship between political and economic beliefs and attitudes to science and technology this paper sets out to test the hypothesis that attitudes to science and technology have direct implications for individuals' job aspirations. Though attitudes to technology were found to be multidimensional the data provide evidence to support Cotgrove's thesis for those aspiring to technological jobs. Such individuals possess attitudes entirely congruent with their aspirations. However, the pattern of attitudes and beliefs for those aspiring to welfare oriented work, principally females, was less clear cut, thus providing only equivocal support for Cotgrove's position.
