Communication apprehension (CA), an individual difference variable not previously examined within assessment centres, was negatively related to critical thinking and oral communication scores. CA also mediated the relationships between participants' extraversion and emotional stability and their dimension scores. In addition, results indicated that for critical thinking scores, there was a significant interaction between exercise form (i.e., a presentation vs. group discussion) and CA.
