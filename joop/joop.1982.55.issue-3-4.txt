Further to a paper reporting consistency in the ranking of labour turnover rates among industrial organizations in the same geographic area over a two-year period, a follow-up study is described with a larger sample over a longer time span. The nine-year period reviewed is characterized by significant changes in the state of the economy which resulted in considerably lower levels of turnover in all the companies. Relative to one another however, the turnover rates of individual companies remained in substantially the same rank order. Rankings show a statistically consistent stability, supporting the conclusions of the previous study that internal, institutional factors, independent of the outside economic climate, act as determinants of high employee wastage.
