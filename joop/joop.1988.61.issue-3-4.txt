This study compared the validity of judgemental and mechanical methods of combining information obtained from an assessment centre. The predictive validities (five criteria) of the overall assessment rating (OAR) were compared with corresponding validities obtained for a unit-weighted composite of five AC measures (n = 157). Validities of the composite were higher for each criterion, and this remained the case after correction for the differential effects of range restriction.
