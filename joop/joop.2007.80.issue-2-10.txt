This study involved analysis of the preference for, and the actual use of eight influence tactics by managers. Managers (N = 95) filled out questionnaires. As predicted, the expected utilities of tactics were correlated strongly with both actual and preferred frequencies of use of tactics. The expected utilities of specific tactics did not correlate with actual and preferred frequencies of use of all other tactics (with some exceptions).
