A grieving stages framework based on Kubler-Ross (1969) was successfully operationalized and applied to an anticipated worksite closure for 53 complete data employees across four times in a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility. As predicted, the means for denial, bargaining, and depression significantly decreased, while exploration increased. However, anger and acceptance remained stable over time. Grieving stages were used as individual outcomes at Times 2 (N=89), 3 (N=77), and 4 (N=53) in regression analyses to test additional study hypotheses. Perceived contract violation had the strongest influence on grieving stages. Perceived job alternatives became more important for exploration and acceptance of leaving at Time 4. Being the primary income source, having lower core self-evaluation, and stronger community ties were generally linked to greater employee depression about leaving the company across times. Additional applications for the suggested grieving stages measure are needed in future job loss research.
