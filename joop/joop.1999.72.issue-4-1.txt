The privacy concerns of applicants have received much attention. However, little is known about the type of information co-workers need and desire about applicants. This research examined the issue of privacy and selection fairness from the perspectives of potential applicants and their prospective co-workers. Results showed that employees want to know about controllable, negative and interpersonal items concerning applicants. Also, items seen as most invasive by potential applicants were the same items that, as co-workers, they least wanted to know. However, in some cases, individuals were interested in knowing information that they would be reluctant to reveal as applicants.
