Seventy-two male and female graduate students in management evaluated 12 fictitious job applicant resumés with respect to three types of jobs (Black-held, neutral, White-held). Four resumés per job were evaluated, which represented a high qualifications White, a high qualifications Black, a low qualifications White, and a low qualifications Black. The subjects rated the job applicants as to hirability and starting salary assignment. Additionally, the subjects indicated the one job applicant they would hire for each job if only one applicant could be hired. Analyses of variance revealed that Blacks received significantly higher hirability and salary assignment ratings than Whites for the Black-typed job, while Whites were rated more favourably than Blacks for the White-typed job. The ‘one choice’ data indicated a similar pattern.
