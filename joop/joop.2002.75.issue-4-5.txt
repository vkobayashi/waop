A longitudinal panel study in 25 work groups of elementary school teachers examined the effect of attitudinal dissimilarity and time on social integration across a 9-month period. In line with the prediction based on both the similarity-attraction approach and social identity theory, cross-lagged regression and LISREL analyses showed that attitudinal dissimilarity decreased social integration rather than the other way around. In addition, results showed that this effect was not stronger for group members who had spent a longer period of time with the other group members. Finally, mediated regression analyses revealed that attitude dissimilarity did not mediate the effect of time on social integration.
