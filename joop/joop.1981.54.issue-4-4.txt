To throw light on the effects of sex on the judgements made in the employment interview a study was carried out on the interview results of 200 male and 200 female candidates for work in a bank. Interview records showed significant differences between male and female interviewers: the latter saw candidates as better dressed, better groomed, more cooperative, more alert and more cheerful. However, on three evaluative scales—impact on workmates, impact on customers, and an overall rating—there was no difference between them. Knowledge of test results played a significant, though small, part with male interviewers but not with female interviewers. The implications of the findings are discussed.
