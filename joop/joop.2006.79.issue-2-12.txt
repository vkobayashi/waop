Although the prevalence of employee monitoring and surveillance technologies (MSTs; e.g. e-mail monitoring) is increasing, very little research has explored the question of whether employees simply accept these systems (compliance) or enact strategies for thwarting them (resistance). In the present study, we proposed a framework based on the theory of planned behaviour and ethical decision making research to predict employees' MST compliance and resistance intentions. We proposed that organizational commitment, organizational identification, and attitudes towards surveillance would predict intentions, with the relationships between attitudes and intentions being moderated by employees' perceived behavioural control and social norms. Moderated multiple regression models were tested and provided support for predictions about the attitudinal and belief constructs, and partial support for predictions about behavioural control and norms. Implications for organizational MST policies and practices are discussed.
