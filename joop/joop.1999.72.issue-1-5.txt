This study examined whether self-esteem moderates the relationship between role stressors and both psychological and physical strains. Unlike previous studies, however, both global and organization-based self-esteem measures were utilized. Based on previous research, it was hypothesized that moderator effects would be most prevalent using the organization-based measure when both stressors and strains were measured from an organizational frame of reference. When both stressors and strains were not measured from an organizational frame of reference, it was felt that an organization-based self-esteem measure would not necessarily produce more moderator effects. Overall, results showed some support for moderator effects. However, these differed very little as a function of self-esteem measurement. Implications for the study of self-esteem in occupational stress research are discussed.
