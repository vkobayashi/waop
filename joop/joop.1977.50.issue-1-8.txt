Leadership potential was studied as a function of the sex of the rater and/or ratee. Data collected on a sample of ten female and 30 male Army officers included peer ratings, self-ratings, and achievement and attitude measures. Males and females evaluated female peers significantly lower than male peers on leadership potential. Also, females evaluated themselves lower on self-ratings of leadership potential, as well as scoring lower on some achievement and attitude measures.
