The present paper introduces a conceptual model of teacher stress, two data sets are employed to discover variables relevant to the model, and the interrelationships between the variables are studied through a structural equations method, LISREL. A pupil-related stressor is shown to be the most important antecedent to a state of general strain, mental disorders, and psychosomatic symptoms. The role of time- and management-related stressors is more ambiguous. Swedish comprehensive school teachers show high levels of work-related strain and are, to a very large degree, dissatisfied with their work. It is concluded that the inclusion of individual characteristics other than biographical ones, and of factors related to salary, career structure and occupational status, would probably increase the explanatory power of the presented models.
