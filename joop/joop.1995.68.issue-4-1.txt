In this study hypotheses on the differential psychological effects of voluntary and involuntary job change versus remaining in the same job on perceived work characteristics and outcomes were tested. Subjects were young adults, who were interviewed and completed a questionnaire in two waves: 1987 and 1991. Measures included nine work perceptions (organizational, departmental and task related variables) and five work outcomes: job satisfaction, organizational commitment, intention to leave, absenteeism and tardiness. Three subgroups were compared: (1) young adults who stayed in the same job (N = 217), (2a) young adults who voluntarily changed jobs (N = 168), and (2b) people who changed jobs involuntarily (N = 79) between time 1 and time 2. Using tests of differences in correlation coefficients over time, t tests, multivariate and univariate analyses of variance of mean scores at time 2, controlling time 1 scores and biographical variables, the hypotheses were partially confirmed by the data. In line with the hypotheses, perceptions and outcomes of job changers had lower correlation coefficients over time than those of stayers. With respect to change in mean scores on these variables the hypotheses were confirmed for the voluntary job changers: they experienced more positive work characteristics and outcomes in time. Involuntary changers did not change in this respect, and stayers experienced significantly more negative work characteristics and outcomes in time, which was not predicted. The results indicate that young employees should have an active attitude towards their career and that the career policy of organizations should include regular job mobility.
