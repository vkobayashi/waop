Responses to five established personality scales (CPI, OPQ CM5.2, OPQ32n, FIRO-B and MBTI) were obtained from large samples of the British population between 16 and 64 years of age. Significant age differences were present for about half the scales, and non-linear patterns occurred in 10% of cases. Older people were found to be, for instance, more conscientious, traditional and careful in interaction with others, and less sociable, outgoing, change orientated and career motivated. No age differences were present for traits such as social confidence, assertiveness, independence, worrying and critical. Contrary to findings about fluid intelligence, personality variation around the mean at older ages was not greater than at younger ages.
