Three series of experiments are reported. Each series is concerned with a different aspect of efficient data collection via formalized question and answer protocols. In series 1 it is found that people are faster endorsing an answer (e.g. circle what does apply) than negating one (e.g. delete what does not apply). In series 2 it is found that people are faster responding to statements offering multiple alternatives within a sentence frame (e.g. I am single/married) than responding to yes/no questions (e.g. Are you married?). However this advantage for sentence frame questions depends on the multiple alternatives being at the end of the sentence rather than at the beginning. Series 3 addresses administrative issues. Here it is found that error-checking procedures are faster when the form-filler has endorsed rather than negated items. It is also found that many form-fillers ignore instructions about how to respond. The implications of these findings for the revision of forms to meet the requirements of automated data processing facilities are discussed. Throughout, the economic consequences of good form design are emphasized.
