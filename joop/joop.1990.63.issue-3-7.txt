This study investigated the extent of convergence among SDy estimates from three different techniques. As reported, the dollar-based (Schmidt, Hunter, McKenzie & Muldrow, 1979) and performance-based (Eaton, Wing & Mitchell, 1985) judgemental estimates were nearly equivalent to the precentage of salary SDy estimate (Hunter, Schmidt & Judiesch, in press). Close inspection revealed that these similarities were, in large part, attributable to the various measures of central tendency adopted by these procedures.
