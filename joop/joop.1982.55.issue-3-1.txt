This case study concerns the development of selection criteria for the job of setter in the plastics injection-moulding industry. The methodology employed a structured job analysis technique (the Position Analysis Questionnaire) and its related attribute bank to identify those aptitudes which are involved in the setter's job. Those aptitudes which were identified as highly relevant were then translated into five appropriate psychometric measures with which a sample of 14 setters was tested. The concurrent validity of two of these measures with overall job performance was found to be high (R = +0.91). The implications of this result are discussed in the context of the present case study, together with the potential use of this methodology for personnel selection.
