The following study was undertaken to explore the link between individual differences in personality orientation and subsequent leadership behaviours in the workplace. More specifically, relationships among two measures of personality and one measure of transformational–transactional leadership style were investigated using data collected from 253 senior executives (and their direct reports) from a highly diversified global corporation. After an initial examination of the personality variables using a correlational approach, a k-means cluster analysis was used to generate four distinct ‘groups’ based on the mean personality orientation or style exhibited. These groups were labelled accordingly in order to reflect the dispositional characteristics among each cluster of executives: (1) innovators for change or inventors; (2) analytical coordinators or managers; (3) organized pragmatists or implementors; and (4) enthusiastic idealists or motivators. Subsequent ANOVA models using these cluster groups yielded significant differences with respect to the perceptions of both executives and their direct reports of their leadership behaviour. In general, inventors and motivators were found to be more transformational in their leadership style than managers and implementors. These results are discussed in terms of the characteristics of each personality cluster and their respective linkages to the leadership behaviours observed by self and others.
